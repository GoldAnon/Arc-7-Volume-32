*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――The complicated discussion in the large chamber was approaching a temporary conclusion.

???: [To be frank, the situation had been vastly different from what we had expected at the start. However, I can say that having been able to avoid the fall of the Fortress City and acquire the cooperation of General Yorna are definite good results]

It was Zikr who quickly gathered the topics flying around and began summarizing them.

With fluffy hair and those wide eyes, he looked over the faces of everyone in the large chamber. To Zikr's words, Emilia nodded and said "Yes, that's right.]

Emilia: [Some disheartening things also happened, but the fact that everyone is gathered here is because we did our best. This time, let's rely on that and make everyone's goals come true.]

Zikr: [As expected, thank you for your beautiful response, Miss Emily. It is as you said, let us strive to fulfill the goals of everyone here. To that end, there is one more thing I must tell you]

???: [One last point, is it? ...I do not feel very good about it if it will be a continuation of our discussion a moment ago]

Seeing Zikr's single raised finger as he nodded at Emilia's words, Otto grumbled as his cheeks twitched.

"Indeed," Zikr continued, as if to bolster Otto's bad premonition.

Zikr: [This would be a continuation of the previous discussion. This discussion also involves Miss Natsumi, who is being treated like the black-haired crown prince]

Emilia: [Natsumi...Eh? But isn't Subaru the one being treated like the Emperor's child...]

Frederica: [Emily, we do not know how Subaru-sama is introducing himself in the Empire]

Emilia: [Ah, I see. That's right. I'm sorry, I got it all mixed up in my head]

Having interrupted the discussion, Emilia placed her hand over her mouth.

The alias "Natsumi Schwartz" that Subaru was introducing himself under in the Empire was his plan to conceal his true identity while informing Emilia and the others searching for him of his whereabouts.

For that reason, Subaru was intentionally using the name of someone Emilia and the others knew ――Emilia's friend, "Natsumi Schwartz.

When Zikr met Subaru, it was while he had been using that alias.

That was likely why Zikr was calling Subaru "Natsumi.] That was what had gotten mixed up inside Emilia.

Emilia: [Huh? But if that's the case, why is he being called Miss Natsumi?...]

Beatrice: [Keep talking, in fact, shaggy-head. It will soon be time for Betty to sleep again, I suppose]

Emilia: [Ah, I see. That's right. I'm sorry, I have to think about Beatrice right now]

The question that had risen up within Emilia had been sunk down by the voice of Beatrice in her arms. If it had anything to do with Subaru, it was natural that Beatrice would want to hear it even more than Emilia did.

For the sake of the girl who could not stay awake for very long, she had to set aside her present questions.

Prompted by Beatrice's and Emilia's gazes, Zikr started by saying, "Well, actually".

Zikr: [Strictly speaking, it is not about Miss Natsumi herself. I am worried about her welfare as her whereabouts are unknown, but I believe that just as Abel-dono had thought, wherever she is found, she will be courteously protected. However――]

Emilia: [Is there something making you uncertain about Subaru being in danger?]

Zikr: [As I prefaced, it is not about Miss Natsumi herself. A separate situation that has extended from that...the existence of His Excellency the Emperor's child is now well-known publicly, causing changes in the Empire's internal situation. In other words――]

???: [――Has aggression also risen in other lands as well?]

The one who quietly interrupted Zikr's words had been Abel.

Furthermore, without looking his way when Zikr bowed reverently with a "Yes", Abel ran his fingers along the cheek of his Oni mask, hiding the expression on his face.

However, just before his hand could hide his expression, Emilia's eyes had surely grasped it.

――That Abel's lips had taken on just the slightest hint of a nasty smile.

Emilia: [I don't think this is a funny discussion at all, but...]

???: [It is, as the half-devil said, this is an unpleasant discussion. The opportunists are taking advantage of the circumstances.]

Priscilla affirmed what Emilia had muttered as she looked at Abel, who had hidden his expression.

Having declared that she would not wear a jacket no matter how cold it was, she shrugged her white shoulders,

Priscilla: [If you have a righteous cause, and have acquired the chance to fulfill your own desires, all that is left is to decide under what timing you shall act. If it is too early, you will be made to bleed as well, but if it is too late, you will come home empty-handed even if you participate. Let us consider it a period of ascertainment]

Otto: [Rebellions everywhere...I had heard that Emperor Vincent Vollachia's reign was stable and that the Imperial citizens enjoyed peace]

Abel: [In the end, peace and the like are nothing more than fleeting, ephemeral, idyllic things]

At Priscilla's and Otto's words, Abel lowered the hand he had placed on his face. Out of the lips where any trace of the smile Emilia had seen had already disappeared, Abel continued speaking dispassionately.

Abel: [The essence of the citizens of the Empire――no, the essence of mankind lies in struggle, and as long as there is life, the fire known as the fighting spirit will not be extinguished. Even if you try to put a lid on it, the heat will continue to build up inside.]

Otto: [And then eventually, there's a big explosion with nowhere to run?]

Petra: [That's really bad timing...]

Otto and Petra each expressed their own impressions of Abel's manner of speaking.

Emilia also thought she understood the intention of Abel's abstruse expression. Looking at the outcome that had occurred, it was not possible to deny that idea.

However, she did not like the idea that fighting was natural for humans.

Emilia: [I don't really get it, but, that sounds reaaally depressing]

Abel: [Depressing? What makes you think so, half-devil]

Emilia: [Because, the Emperor of the Empire must have worked as hard as he could. For all of that to get destroyed, and to not be rewarded for that hard work, wouldn't that be depressing? Whether he wins or loses, it would be painful, I think]

The Emperor of Vollachia, whom she never had directly met, seems very pitiful to Emilia.

It was also true that Abel, Zikr, and the others were raising a rebellion in this manner, and that once the people of the Empire had joined in, they started to raise their voices together.

Emilia had also learned that the fact that the Vollachian Empire had not had a large battle these past few years was Emperor Vincent Vollachia's achievement. Setting aside what Vincent was thinking, at least he had been continuing to create a society without war.

With that having been destroyed, if he lost, the country would be taken from him, and even if he won, he would have ended up having waged a war himself.

Emilia: [A thing like this, it seems like someone decided that whenever anyone gets angry, things just become even more painful]

For that reason, Emilia could not help but feel sorry for Vincent.

If it was possible, she thought it would be good if they could properly discuss just what in the world he was thinking, and what they could do to arrive at a good ending for everyone.

Abel: [――. I see, regardless of which came first, I understand the way that ought to be]

Emilia: [Eh?]

Abel: [Undoubtedly, you people are of the same sort as Natsuki Subaru]

Emilia's breath quietly got caught in her throat at those words Abel had said with his arms crossed.

Faced with the glint in Abel's black eyes, which could be seen behind the Oni mask, Emilia had become aware of something. ――Sure enough, with what had been said just now, the impression she had felt was not wrong.

Even though Subaru and Abel were comrades, and had been continuously working together until Emilia and the others had entered the Vollachian Empire――,

Emilia: [――Do you reaaally hate Subaru?]

Abel: [――――]

Emilia: [I'm sorry if I'm wrong. Still, I don't think I'm wrong]

His black eyes narrowing, Abel went silent in response to Emilia's question. Seeing his reaction right in front of her, Emilia did not retract her opinion.

Abel hated Subaru. ――Emilia felt that was so.

It was not because Abel was quiet, or because he said haughty things in a manner that somewhat resembled Priscilla. There was a definite difference when he spoke to Otto or Zikr and the others.

Emilia felt that was the hatred Abel held for Subaru.

Abel: [――Zikr, coordinate with those who have begun raising their voices in rebellion. Generate even stronger winds and grow the power of the flames. Until the black smoke reaches the Imperial Capital]

Zikr: [Will that be all right? The original purpose of the "Nine Divine Generals" was...]

Abel: [That is only a secondary goal. The important thing is establishing a state of war. The standpoints of Groovy and Moguro are concerning, but the situation has changed]

Abruptly, Abel, who had taken his eyes off of Emilia, began to give instructions to Zikr beside him.

Emilia thought she had been ignored, but that was Abel's declaration that he did not intend to continue their current conversation anymore.

Was the reason he did not respond because she had been off the mark, or was it something else?

In any case――

Abel: [――We may be ready to attack the Imperial Capital sooner than expected. Absolutely do not lose focus]

――In order to reunite with Subaru and Rem, Emilia and the others had no choice but to change course and separate from Abel and his group.

△▼△▼△▼△

Beatrice: [Emilia, you have to be careful, in fact! Betty and the others are the only people in this Country who genuinely care only for Subaru, I suppose.]

Beatrice spoke again shortly before she fell back asleep after their discussion in the hall.

The conversation veered off to the left and right, but if one focuses solely on Subaru, it is hard to say that it was the best situation for him. Even if the threat to his life could be reduced, even if only a little.

Emilia: [Subaru is not someone who would be okay with that, with everyone arguing around him.]

Beatrice: [In, fact!]

Otto and Abel surmised that his life is guaranteed no matter on which side of the empire he is captured on. It's what the smart kids think, and they may be right.

But when has Subaru ever behaved exactly the way Emilia and the others thought he would?

If people around him are in danger, Subaru would move immediately, neglecting himself.

She couldn't believe that she was the only one who would accept being safe in such a situation.

That's why――

Emilia: [――I want you to remember that we all still care about Subaru and Rem, so we're going to work with the intention of putting them first.]

Priscilla: [And, why are you bothering to proclaim this to me?]

Emilia: [Because, if I did it on my own without telling anyone, everyone would get in trouble, right?]

It's important to communicate one's goals and principles properly.

Not telling Frederica and Petra whether or not they would be back by dinner would be a waste of the meal that they had prepared for them.

Emilia: [Subaru also used to say that spi-nuhch was important. But I am not sure what spinach is...]

Priscilla: [On what haphazard foundation did you have the nerve to approach me with such vague knowledge? Was that courage you have cultivated from your experience of being persecuted as a half-demon?]

Emilia: [No, I don't think so. When I was in my home forest, and everyone hated me, I didn't feel like I was getting used to it or getting stronger.]

When she was living in the Great Elior Forest, she was hurt no matter what anyone said to her. Expecting the slightest thing, being betrayed, and not learning anything, despite repeating it over and over again.

So, if Emilia now looks a little bit stronger.

Emilia: [It’s thanks to Subaru and everyone else… that I left the forest, participated in the Royal Selection, went through a lot of hard times, and became the person I am today, and Priscilla is no different, right?]

Priscilla: [Do not compare yourself with me, mineself was born perfect.]

Emilia: [Yes… but I won't lose to you either.]

Priscilla: [You can attest for yourself whether you are worthy of the words that have passed your lips. Whether or not it catches the corner of my eye depends on that.]

Priscilla responded to Emilia's tightly clenched fist with a shrug of her shoulders.

After the discussion in the hall was over and Beatrice was returned to the inn, now having fallen asleep, Emilia was looking for Priscilla to tell her about the previously mentioned plans.

Perhaps she is busy, she thought, but fortunately, she was listening to her.

Emilia: [When I think back, Priscilla always gets things right, doesn't she?]

Priscilla: [Ho, it appears that some unpleasantness is about to ensue for me.]

Emilia: [Should I stop?]

Priscilla: [Fine, you are forgiven. You may continue.]

Emilia responded with a nod to Priscilla, closing one eye and urging her to proceed.

Leaving City Hall, they walked alongside one another down the street. Emilia, not seeing her companions Schult and Al, looked around for the two of them.

Emilia: [It's been that way since the beginning of the Royal Selection; Priscilla says nasty things and interrupts her opponents in mid-sentence, and yet she does a good job of listening to what they have to say while also lending an ear.]

Priscilla: [Even I have not the ability to surmise everything in the world. Shall I not be curious to see what kind of drivel will come out of the mouth of some other than mineself?]

Emilia: [Well? But I remember Anastasia-san said to me, "I'm not going to talk to you.].]

Priscilla: [That She-fox.]

Emilia: [Eeh. Uh, you're not talking about holding a grudge, are you?]

With Priscilla walking leisurely by her side, Emilia thinks back to her exchange with Anastasia.

Initially, at the Royal Selection, Anastasia tried to snub Emilia from the discussions. That in itself is not an unusual treatment, and she did not hold it against Anastasia.

However, the point is――

Emilia: [――I'm friends with Anastasia-san.]

Priscilla: [――――]

Emilia: [To put it correctly, I promised that we would be friends. I said we would after the Royal Selection… I felt like we could do that, no matter where we started off. That's why.]

Priscilla: [Surely you do not wish to form a friendship with me as well?]

Emilia: [Eeh. Is that wrong?]

Because of her successful experience with Anastasia, Emilia mustered up the courage to try.

Most people, if it were Anastasia and Priscilla, would have the impression and assessment that Priscilla was more difficult to deal with. However, Emilia was different.

Anastasia and Priscilla are valued nearly equally to Emilia, who has few relationships.

Therefore, it can be concluded that this is what led to this kind of offer.

Then, in response to Emilia's offer, Priscilla pulled her fan out of her cleavage and.

Priscilla: [Behold, more drivel that even I could not have contemplated suddenly sprang forth.]

Opening her fan with a sound, she abruptly cut Emilia's words off.

At Priscilla's response, Emilia's eyes widened, and she let out a tiny giggle. Seeing her smile, Priscilla's eyes narrowed.

Priscilla: [What follows drivel, absolute drivel? Either way, you are displeasing me.]

Emilia: [Oh, no, no, sorry. However, I felt that I might be able to say no to you, Priscilla, so I just knew that. I'll ask again tomorrow.]

Priscilla: [Tomorrow or not, my answer shall remain the same.]

Emilia: [But, you never know what tomorrow will bring.]

For the time being, Emilia believes that it is not wrong to take up the challenge boldly.

Of course, there is the worry that she will think it is harassment and hate her even more.

But if Emilia thought so, then Priscilla was――

Priscilla: [Do as you please.]

Emilia: [Yeah, I will do that.]

Even if she dismisses it as futile, she will not use force to keep her from doing so.

Emilia also feels like she is taking advantage of the situation, though, because she is in a difficult position to do so.

In any case

Priscilla: [Well? Was that the conclusion of your ambush on me?]

Emilia: [No, that was only the first one… not the second one, because of what happened with Subaru. There's something else I still want to talk about.]

" Now, what is the purpose of discussing the first matter with me? As long as your proposed plan does not interfere with my course of action, I will have nothing to do with it.]

Emilia: [But Priscilla is good friends with Abel and Zikr, right? You seem to be discussing a lot of things, and I was wondering if you could tell everyone.]

Priscilla: [I withdraw my previous statement. Your drivel dances beyond my imagination. It is not often that I change my words.]

Emilia: [――? Is that something I should be happy about? Is that bad?]

Her crimson eyes looked to the side toward Emilia, bending her lips when she didn't get an answer.

It was probably not very welcome, but if one does not know what exactly was wrong, there is no way to fix it, even if one thinks it should be fixed.

As Priscilla is good friends with Abel and Zikr, it should be correct, so it would be a mistake to tell everyone else, what Emilia and her group's plans are?

However, Emilia and her group would be much better off going to talk to them in person.

Anyhow――

Emilia: [I don't know if I can get along very well with Abel...]

Priscilla: [Ku.]

Emilia: [Priscilla?]

Holding her open fan to her mouth, Priscilla made a small chuckle. When Emilia looked over to her side, Priscilla slightly relaxed the corners of her eyes and said.

Priscilla: [To loathe you, one who even tries to speak to me, is the pinnacle of his incompetence.]

Emilia: [Mmm, it's not that I don't like them. I just thought it might be a little bit hard for you.]

Priscilla: [Those main factors behind a sense of aversion and disgust, when accumulated, are called proclivities. However, it is probably natural for you people to evaluate Abel in such a manner ――Mineself wonders if your judgment is correct]

Emilia: [...Priscilla, do you feel the same way?]

Priscilla remained silent, not responding to Emilia's question.

However, to Emilia, it had felt as if that silence was saying that she shared Emilia's opinion that Abel hated Subaru.

Emilia: [Priscilla, do you know why? Up until a little while ago, you were talking to Abel and the others, weren't you?]

Priscilla: [Unfortunately, the discussion that had kept mineself back had no relation to your foolish commoner. Fragments that have broken off like that foolish commoner do not become the subject of conversation...no, having heard the tale of the Great Disaster which destroyed the Demon City, mineself will not say it was completely unrelated to that foolish commoner]

Emilia: [Of the Demon City... Ah, then, you were talking to Yorna? To Priscilla's mother]

In the middle of the discussion in the large chamber, the topic of the parent-child relationship between Yorna and Priscilla had come up. In the end, it had been swept away by the matter of how Louis should be handled that arose later, but that probably would not have happened for the people involved.

Naturally, the reunited mother and child should have discussed it.

Emilia: [Still, I was also surprised. That Priscilla also had half demi-human blood...]

Priscilla: [Nonsense. Do not equate mineself with you. I think it surely must not be the case, but did you draw close to me because you had felt an affinity over that?]

Emilia: [That wasn't it at all, but is it not true? Then, is Yorna-san Priscilla's foster parent? If that were so, that would also be surprising. After all, I also…]

Priscilla: [Nonsense, do not make me repeat mineself, nonsense. That too, is your rashness.]

Emilia: [Ehh? Then, what do you mean?]

If Yorna and her were biologically parent and child, her foxkin blood should be flowing inside Priscilla, but that had been denied.

If you were then to think that meant a foster parent, that had also been flatly denied.

Emilia, being a half-elf and raised by her mother, a dear aunt by blood named Fortuna, had thought Priscilla was the same in some ways.

Emilia: [Not blood related, and not a foster parent ...in that case, how is she your mother?]

Priscilla: [Is there any reason why mineself must explain everything to you?]

Emilia: [No, I don't think so. But if you don't tell me, I'll be reaaally curious]

Knowing it was selfish, Emilia had tried asking Priscilla for the truth. The possibility had been high that just as she had rejected a friendly relationship, she would refuse her an answer.

However, Priscilla was silent for a moment, and then,

Priscilla: [――Iris and the King of Thorns]

Emilia: [Eh? ]

Priscilla: [It is an old story. Do you know it?]

Emilia: [Well, I do know it. Umm, Lady Petra likes that kind of thing]

Emilia's eyes widened as she nodded at the words that had abruptly left Priscilla's lips.

She had been taught that "Iris and the King of Thorns” was an old story that had been passed down from long, long ago, and was a historical account that originated from the Vollachian Empire.

Emilia had also heard no more than a brief outline of the story, but it seemed like it was a love story between an emperor of Vollachia from long ago called the "King of Thorns," and a girl named "Iris.]

Unfortunately, Emilia had ended up saying that she still did not really understand why it was interesting but――,

Emilia: [What is the issue with that story? Is it a story that Priscilla likes?]

Priscilla: [It seems you are a half-devil who cannot understand things from context. Naturally, it is bound to be related to the flow of the conversation thus far]

Emilia: [Thus far...Yorna and Priscilla's parent-child relationship and this old story?]

Priscilla: [――Iris and the King of Thorns had joined hands to bring about an end to a civil war that had swallowed up many races in the Empire However, right before the pair that were linked heart-to-heart could be wedded, they experienced a betrayal, and the story ends.

Emilia: [...A sad story, isn't it.]

As the corners of her eyebrows dropped, Emilia muttered the gist of the story Priscilla had told.

It was very disheartening when people who have worked their hardest are not rewarded. Just as she despaired at the situation the Emperor of Vollachia was placed in now, she held the same feelings for the end of the couple that had already been made into a story.

At Emilia's reaction, Priscilla exhaled with a "Ha",

Priscilla: [However, the story and the facts of history differ. In the histories, having lost Iris to betrayal, the "King of Thorns" descended into madness, and decided to eradicate the wolfmen and molemen that had raised their blades. For the few that had escaped, in the Empire, even now, they are burned at the stake as soon as they are found]

Emilia: [It's understandable to be angry about that but ...... still, for people in this day and age]

Priscilla: [It has nothing to do with them, does it? You should be no stranger to that, having been persecuted as a half-devil yourself]

Emilia: [――――]

The sharpness of Priscilla's phrasing had stung, but Emilia's skin was hard as iron against that sort of bad-mouthing. However, even if she did not bleed, the pain of being struck remained the same.

As she would properly complain about that later, Emilia was more curious about where things went from there in the rest of Priscilla's story.

What had the King of Thorns done after losing Iris and taking revenge on the traitor?

Emilia: [With that, is the story of the King of Thorns over?]

Priscilla: [――. With having merely given in to anger, you could not possibly say that was having descended into madness. Thus, after that, the King of Thorns had directed his madness towards Iris, who had been lost]

Emilia: [Towards Iris?]

Raising her eyebrows at the story's unexpected course of events, Emilia repeated back the words she had heard. Priscilla nodded at those words and turned her crimson eyes to the sky.

Frustrated, Emilia's lips trembled as she sought Priscilla's next words.

Emilia: [What did the King of Thorns do to Iris?]

Priscilla: [He laid a curse upon her]

Emilia: [A curse? That's...]

Was that something one would lay on someone precious to them, much less someone whose loss caused them suffering?

Indifferent to those doubts of Emilia's, Priscilla spoke of the details of the curse.

That was――,

Priscilla: [――The secret art of dragging a perished soul back down to earth without handing it over to Od Lagna]

Emilia: [The soul, of a dead person?]

Priscilla: [It is said that there is a secret art called "Sacrament of the Immortal King" which can even revive the dead, but its existence is considered questionable. However, this "Commandment of Thorns" is a curse born of insatiable yearning.]

The story of the dead coming back to life is astounding, but what is important here is not that, but the other "curse" as they called it.

The subject of the souls of the dead and their fate was also discussed at the Pleiades Watchtower through the " Books of the Dead," in which the memories of the deceased were imprinted within them.

The existence of the "Books of the Dead" convinced them of the existence of the soul within humans.

Emilia: [But, what does it mean to drag down a soul? Does it mean they come back to life?]

Priscilla: [It does not work that way. Iris's body was torn apart after her death, and even if her soul returned, it would not bring her back to life. In the first place, the Commandment of Thorn has no such power.]

Emilia: [Then what would happen? If there was no body――]

Where would the soul go if there is no place for the returning soul to enter?

In response to Emilia's question, Priscilla quietly lowered her gaze. Instead of looking at the sky, her crimson eyes looked into Emilia's amethyst ones, and――

Priscilla: [It is settled upon. If the soul does not return to Od Laguna, it will return to the world where it will not receive its intended treatment and will enter its next vessel. ――It is a rebirth or a reincarnation.]

Emilia: [――――]

Priscilla: [As long as the curse is not broken, as long as the Commandment of thorns that entangles them is not lifted, the reincarnation of the departed soul will repeat. Again and again, it will repeat itself, repeating life and death over and over again. ――One of these lives, the life before Yorna Mishigure, was my dear mother's.]

△▼△▼△▼△

Abel: [――Sandra Benedict, that caught me by surprise.]

Yorna: [My Lord, you were the one who hid Prisca from me, you were the one who is a bad person.]

Hard, cold voices collided with each other, and quiet heat intermingled in a stone room.

Both of them looked at each other and chose their words as if they were searching each other's hearts. Abel, removed the Oni mask covering his face and revealing his true face, and Yorna, puffed purple smoke from her kiseru.


Until just now, there was also a third "Priscilla" there.

However, as soon as she deemed that she had concluded the essential discussions, she immediately left this place. Abel accepted this attitude, but it did not dissuade Yorna from being upset.

Of course. ――The mistress of the Demon City cannot easily accept the change in her own biological child.

Yorna: [Why not both honestly admit that our secrecy has been a detriment to each other?]

Abel: [I had my reasons for keeping it a secret. Even you can understand that.]

Yorna: [――. That's true, I guess.]

At Abel's answer, Yorna ponders, her eyes downcast and her long eyelashes quivering.

The unexpected encounter with Priscilla sent a huge ripple through Yorna's heart. It was a reality that Yorna had never expected, or even hoped for, for it was never going to come true.

For Yorna, it must have been a great joy to see Priscilla alive and well, and for Abel, it must have been a terrible gamble.

The idea that Priscilla is Prisca and that she would be alive is unthinkable.

There is no doubt that Abel's involvement was behind that unthinkable event.

Yorna: [What is my Lord doing――?]

Abel: [――I promised you the means to break the commandment of the thorn. If you want the answer to your question, I have no reason to grant you any other reward.]

Yorna: [――――]

Straight away, Abel rejected Yorna's challenge.

When Abel refuses to reveal the answer, forcing Yorna to weigh it against her greatest wish.

For a long, long time now, she has lived and died many times, and she has continued to view the world with this soul.

Even though she could barely remember the face of that person anymore, that's why――

Abel: [Yorna Mishigure ――no, Iris, who the King of Thorns fell in love with at first sight.]

Yes, Yorna's name, a name that beloved man, long ago, called her many times, by a man who is many generations removed from the blood of her beloved man.

Abel: [Raise your spirits even higher. For your dearest wish and, above all - Prisca Benedict, to keep your supposedly lost daughter alive in the future.]

In a voice so cold that it could not be compared to that of her beloved, he insisted.
