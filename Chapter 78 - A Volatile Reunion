*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*


Breathing hard, she ran as if she was flying, while trying not to shake the head of the girl in her arms.

The moment a line of wagons arrived on the city's south side and Emilia overheard that many had arrived from the Demon City Chaosflame, her silver hair danced for the reunion she had been waiting for.

Emilia: [See you soon, Subaru; Beatrice…!]

The girl she picked up in her arms, who’s asleep with her eyelids closed―― Beatrice.

In order to wake up the girl, who’s been sleeping for a long time to reduce exhaustion, it’s absolutely necessary to make contact with Subaru, with whom she has a contract relationship, and receive her mana supply from.

Subaru also needed Beatrice to take his mana, or he’ll be in trouble, so the two were truly in a relationship of mutual destiny.

Their relationship, which usually looked like they were holding hands and smiling, turned into a very difficult situation when Subaru got sent to the empire which led to them being separated.

Subaru and Beatrice needed to be reunited as soon as possible.

And――

Emilia: [――Subaru]

Emilia wanted to ensure Subaru was safe as soon as possible, even if it was just for a second.

She hadn't felt this restless since Puck unilaterally violated the contract and disappeared on his own accord ― no, it was more than that.

Puck may have been fine on his own, but Subaru was not.

Someone who can understand Subaru should be there for him.

Emilia: [Ughhh, I'm sorry!]

Opening her eyes, Emilia took a shortcut to the city hall in front.

While she should have entered through the entrance and then climbed the stairs to the top, it was frustrating for her, so she made an ice scaffold. Riding on top of the icicles rising from the ground, Emilia’s body, holding Beatrice, rose all at once to the top of the building.

It startled the guards and everyone in town, but she couldn't resist.

Now, finally――

Emilia: [Subaru!]

???: [Huh, Emily?]

When the icicles reached the top floor’s height, Emilia jumped from there to the building.

When she landed and looked up, she saw that a good number of people had already gathered at the city hall, and everyone seemed surprised by Emilia's momentum.

In the midst of all this, it was Mizelda, a prosthetic woman with a strong impression of eye power ――who put together the People of Shudraq - who accepted Emilia's appearance with a sense of ease.

She poked the floor with the tip of her wooden prosthetic leg and looked at the icicle behind Emilia, then

Mizelda: [You use magic very conveniently. You are so different from us.]

Emilia: [Hmm, I was in a reaally big hurry, so I went to… Oh, I'm sorry I startled you! I'll dispel it in a second.]

At Mizelda's impressed reaction, Emilia hurriedly dissolved the icicle into mana.

In a kingdom, it is rather common to do this and that with magic, but in an empire, it seems that there are not so many magic users. It is a strange feeling for an empire where many people are said to want to fight.

Mizelda: [Most of the time, if you hit them before they use magic, it's the end for them.]

Emilia: [I might know that too. Only if you're close by, not far away.]

Mizelda: [When you’re far away, that’s when my bow comes in. But Taritta is better with the bow than I am.]

Emilia smiles back at Mizelda, who smiles at her.

The name "Taritta", which she heard several times, must have been the name of Mizelda's sister. Taritta, who was apparently Mizelda's pride and joy, was with the group that left Guaral for Demon City in the southeast.

Emilia: [――! That's right. The people who went south are back, right?]

For a moment, her mind was distracted elsewhere, but that was the reason Emilia had rushed over in such a big hurry using her magic in the first place.

Holding Beatrice next to her chest, Emilia looked around the hall on the top floor.

The fact that there are strangers in travel clothes here and there proved that the people who have arrived at the castle city while traveling by horse and carriage were there.

In the midst of it all――,

Emilia: [Subaru, are you there! We're all here to pick you up! Otto and Petra-san… Petra will be here soon!]

She looked around, searching for the long-awaited black-haired boy in the crowd.

 When Emilia heard at the house where they were staying that a carriage had arrived, she picked Beatrice up in her arms and hurried to the city hall ahead of Petra and Otto.

They would also be running to the city hall to meet Subaru in a big hurry.

Emilia knew that it was unfair of her to rush to the meeting, even though she felt the same way as those two people, gasping for breath. Even so, she wanted to meet Subaru as soon as possible.

In addition to Beatrice, Emilia herself has been with Subaru and――

Emilia: [――hk!] "Subaru!]

Suddenly, her shoulder was tapped from behind, and Emilia turned around feeling as if she had been played.

It was so vigorous that the person who tapped her on the shoulder was startled and widened her eyes. However, it was not Subaru, the one who they were looking for.

Frederica: [Emily…]

Emilia: [Frederica… You were ahead of me. Um, well.]

It was kind of embarrassing, and Emilia didn't know what expression to put on her face.

Of course, Frederica was also worried about Subaru, so it was no surprise that Frederica was at City Hall first.

Emilia: [Well, did you get to talk to Subaru? Look, I want to take Beatrice to see him. I, too, would like to talk to Subaru, but Beatrice first...]

Frederica: [――. I have something I have to tell you.]

Emilia: [Huh?]

Frederica lowers the corner of her beautiful emerald green eyes and speaks somberly to Emilia, as if she were making excuses for her behavior.

She did not know why Frederica had such an attitude.

Emilia: [Oh, Garfiel…]

Looking around, it was not only Frederica but also Garfiel who had arrived at the city hall earlier. When Petra and the others arrived a little later, all of Emilia's companions who had come to Guaral were present.

All of them can greet the previously separated Subaru.

Yes, Emilia was hoping, and yet――

Frederica: [Unfortunately, Subaru-sama has been lost again in the Demon City of Chaosflame… Subaru-sama was not among those who returned via carriage.]

And it was a heartbreaking report that Frederica seemed to have a hard time conveying.

△▼△▼△▼△

Medium: [What’dya mean Big bro and Rem-chan were taken away!?]

With her large, round eyes widening, the girl shouted as she pitter-pattered and stomped her feet.

She was a golden-haired girl with a mysterious hairstyle of braids, ties, and various knots. The girl, who appeared twelve or thirteen years old, looked over at the adults around her with a bewildered face.

Gathered in the city hall of the walled city of Guaral, in the topmost hall, were those who had been assigned various roles in the upheavals of this city or of this empire.

In the middle of such turmoil, Otto Suwen felt like holding his head due to the fact that they were somehow involved.

Although this was in front of those who carried flags with a wolf pierced by a sword. He kept his expression tightened, thinking that it would be unthinkable to show such a weak attitude.

Medium: [I’ve come back and now the city’s a mess, the walls are gone, it's a disaster! I'm so shocked that Big bro and Rem-chan aren’t here, my head’s spinning~!]

Louis: [Aa, uu!]

As she said it, the girl stomped on the ground while her eyes and head were spinning. And another girl of about the same age beside her, the one with blonde hair, grunted in unison.

The adults look puzzled and perplexed by the girls' two-person appeal.

The situation called for someone to take the lead, but Otto was wondering whether he should step in and was ruled by a strange feeling of entrapment that prevented him from moving.

Otto: [...Um, have I seen this groaning girl somewhere?]

Next to the girl who took the initiative to speak, Otto could not help but feel that the girl who did not utter a meaningful word was somehow familiar to him.

Although Otto was generally careful not to forget people with whom he had exchanged words, his memory of times when he drank too much were vague. Since he started working in the Emilia camp, he tried to avoid getting so drunk that he’d lose his memory, but he wondered whether this was a child he came across in that inebriated mood.

Medium: [Hey, how’s Big bro and Rem-chan doing? Does anyone know…]

Zikr: [――Before I go any further, may I make one thing clear, young lady?]

Medium: [Hmm? What’s that, Zikr-chin?]

While Otto was lost in thought, Zikr, the city's representative, approached the girl.

Otto had already exchanged words with him many times and regarded him as a trustworthy partner. Just the fact that he was someone he could communicate with in the empire made him a rare find.

Zikr raised his thick eyebrows and looked at the girl from top to bottom.

Zikr: [If there is no mistake in my perception, is this young lady definitely Miss Medium?]

Medium: [Huh? Of course, what’s wrong? You can tell just by seeing.]

Louis: [Uu!]

The girl with her hands on her hips and her chest puffed out – she is called Medium, and next to her who nodded her head, the girl who he couldn’t remember took the same posture.

At these words, Zikr looked at the person next to Medium with a troubled look on his face.

And――

Zikr: [――Lord Abel, this is.]

Abel: [It is due to Olbart Dunkelkenn's technique. The reason why her answer was off the mark was because of her original education, not because of this condition.]

Zikr: [Indeed. First General Olbart’s technique. …I’m so glad you’re unharmed.]

Medium: [This is unharmed, if you say so.]

After hearing the explanation, Zikr gently puts his hand on his chin with a look of comprehension on his face. The person who made Zikr understand calmly folded his arms and glanced at Medium.

Abel: [The ones that stayed behind are bewildered. They are astonished to see that you have shrunk.]

Medium: [Me? …ah! I see! Sorry, sorry, everyone! I was so used to being shrunk, but now I'm tiny! Together with Subaru-chin!]

With a small body, Medium raised her hand and explained her situation. Otto was not at all convinced by this, but the original imperial group seemed somewhat convinced.

They were confused and couldn’t deny that they didn't know enough, but more importantly, there was something in what she just said that Otto and his friends couldn't miss.

???: [――Subaru]

Louis: [Uau…]

And, at the same time, a faint whisper was uttered, probably with the same meaning.

The girl with a downcast face next to Medium put a tone into the sound that was clearly differentiated from the moan that had come before. And the one who emitted the sound that had the same connotation as that of the girl was,

Emilia: [Are you worried about Subaru, too?]

Yes, it was Emilia who lowered her eyebrows at the girl's appearance.

Emilia, with Beatrice sleeping in her arms, was one of those who was particularly disappointed to hear that Subaru was not in the group returning from Demon City.

Compared to her and Petra, it would be presumptuous to call Otto's feelings disappointment. But it wasn’t because he had a premonition that it might not be so easy to meet again.

In any case――

Louis: [Uu, aau]

Emilia: [No, I don't think it's your fault. I’m reaally disappointed that Subaru isn't here, but this is no time to dwell on it. Because Subaru has been through so much more.]

Louis: [Uu…]

Emilia: [You're worried about me? Thank you. I know you've been through a lot, too.]

The depressed-looking girl and Emilia were communicating with each other in this way.

The words spilled out of the girl's mouth with no clear sense, but Emilia looked her in the eyes and exchanged words as if she understood their meaning.

That in itself spoke to Emilia's determination when she was depressed, and it was an exchange that Otto couldn’t help but feel relieved about. However――

Abel: [――I never expected that Natsuki Subaru's companions would come all the way to visit.]

A voice blew through the hall like a cold, dry wind.

Emilia lifted her gaze and turned towards the person who had spoken with that voice ――the man with the demon mask on his face who had just exchanged words with Zikr and Medium.

Emilia's dark blue eyes narrowed at the sight of the dark-haired man with the Oni mask covering his face,

Emilia: [Are you a friend of Subaru, too?]

Abel: [I have no friends. He doesn’t think of me in that way either. Our relationship is one where we are together while working towards a goal.]

Emilia: [So, you’re a comrade. She called you Abel. Could you be the person Zikr was talking about earlier?]

The man's response was stiff and pointed, but Emilia was unfazed and turned to Zikr. In response to her question, Zikr straightened his back while stating, "Yes.".

Zikr: [This is the one who is in the position to lead us, Lord Abel. I was only entrusted with the city under his direction.]

Abel: [Speaking of which, there certainly has been a lot of wear and tear.]

Zikr: [...I’m truly ashamed about that.]

With a grimace, Zikr bowed deeply to the man ――Abel over the damage the city had suffered.

Instead of dissatisfaction with unreasonable reprimands, Zikr's bitter face was filled with remorse at his own inability to do his job.

Otto, who was present at the actual scene, thought that Zikr and everyone else in the city did their best to prevent the city from being completely destroyed――

Medium: [Abel-chin, don't say mean things like that! Everyone tried their hardest!]

Abel: [But, are you not angry as well because your brother was taken away from you?]

Medium: [Big bro worked so hard to get taken! If Big bro hadn't been taken away, we would have been in big trouble! That’s my Big bro! It's no biggie if they take him away!]

It was Medium who took a vigorous swipe at Abel's statement.

Judging from the flow of the conversation, her brother is probably the male peddler who was kidnapped along with Rem. Mizelda had told me that he was a gentle and friendly lady-killer.

According to other stories by Kuna and Holly, that man and Rem both being taken was the decisive factor causing the enemy "Nine Divine General" to withdraw the flying dragons.

In other words, Medium's remarks about her brother were not far off the mark.

Abel, who had just returned from Demon City, had no way of knowing about this situation――

Abel: [Zikr]

Zikr: [Sir]

Abel: [Don't listen to what I previously said. From the beginning, you were dealing with Madelyn Eschart and a group of flying dragons. You deserve recognition for your work in a situation where the city may have needed to be abandoned.]

Zikr: [――! I am honored]

The words that continued without hesitation were not the result of being struck by Medium's persuasion.

These words were originally prepared to be used against Zikr. From the very beginning, he had no intention of blaming him for the damage suffered by Guaral.

Medium: [...Abel-chin, your personality is awful!]

Louis: [Uu!]

Abel: [Stop]

Medium and the girl attacked Abel from both sides as he stood with his arms crossed. Abel gave a short rebuke as the two of them clung to him, pulling his sleeves and poking him in the waist.

One could get a rough idea of their relationship over there――

???: [――So? When are we going to progress on this?]

Meanwhile, the woman who had been quietly watching the transition finally moved her lips.

It was a fox-eared beauty with a presence terribly out of place, and an excessively glamorous personality ――in a sense, a person who, just by being there, one could not help but be aware of, like Emilia, who had uncommon beauty, and Abel, whose eccentric demon mask was eye-catching.

It's obvious even if it's not explicitly stated.

She is the reason why Abel and Medium left the fortified city for the Demon City of Chaosflame.

???: [First General Yorna Mishigure]

Who said that in so few words?

Perhaps someone in the room called out the name. However since no one voiced a correction, it was self-evident that it was correct.

――Yorna Mishigure.

She is the ruler of the Demon City Chaosflame and a member of the "Nine Divine Generals," the most powerful military officers in the empire.

Having her on their side will be a major nucleus that will shake up the way this broad empire is being run.

The journey on which Subaru went missing was originally intended to recruit her.

Zikr: [First General Yorna, first of all, I would like to thank you for your visit. I am Zikr Osman, a second general of the Vollachian Empire.]

Yorna: [I have heard your name along the way. In-person, you seem to be a good-looking man as Medium and Taritta said.]

Zikr: [Miss Medium and Miss Taritta?]

Zikr, who had begun speaking sternly, blinked at Yorna's response.

This was not the time for this, but his gaze turned to Medium and another tall woman. The brown-skinned woman in male attire, she was probably Taritta, the topic of discussion.

The two responded to Zikr's gaze with a smile and a nod. Zikr, known as the "Womanizer" for his gentlemanly behavior, may have been embarrassed but seemed very happy.

With a cough, he cleared his throat as if to calm his emotions,

Zikr: [So, would First General Yorna be willing to fight alongside Lord Abel?]

Yorna: [You may think of it that way. I have my own agenda, but my interests …are the same as Abel's.]

Abel: [It is settled. There is no issue in the pact with Yorna Mishigure]

Yorna wore a luxurious kimono and held a golden kiseru in her hand. Although her previous reputation gave the impression that she was quite anxious, her demeanor was calm and collected.

Otto’s group had heard that Chaosflame had been severely damaged.

That is why a huge line of carriages arrived at Guaral, and it became a situation where they had to accommodate a large number of people at once.

And in the midst of all the devastation that Demon City suffered――

???: [――Subaru was sent somewhere.]

[――――]

Yes, it was Emilia, with a voice that sounded like a silver bell, who broke into the conversation.

Abel's gaze through the Oni mask turned towards Emilia, entering the story from a different angle. Emilia didn’t flinch, despite the obvious unwelcome gaze.

Beatrice was in her arms, Petra and Frederica stood quietly by her side, and Garfiel had a stern look on his face. Otto may have contributed a little to that as well.

Indeed, Emilia's statement may be just some noise to them.

However, they had their own circumstances. It would be a problem if the conversation proceeded while ignoring them, who had rushed across the border to reach there.

Emilia: [Once more, let's start over from the beginning. ――I am Emily, and you are Abel, right? Subaru’s friend …no, his comrade.]

Abel: [――. Yes]

Emilia: [Subaru had gone to another city with you… well, to Yorna-san's, and then something terrible happened and you got separated. Is that right?]

Yorna: [Yes, that's right. Something terrible thing is not quite the right word, though.]

Both Abel and Yorna nodded at Emilia, raising her well-shaped eyebrows as she confirmed what had just been described. After receiving their reactions, especially Yorna's words, Emilia accepted them with an open heart and said, "That's right.".

From the perspective of the parties involved, the superficial words of an outsider could be offensive, and Emilia, too, was careful to choose her words with care, knowing that her words fell into that category.

Yorna: [I cannot say where Subaru got whisked away to after getting separated from the rest of the group. We searched and could not find him, and there are many people without homes. So, that is why I came back to this city like this, and we are discussing this here… Is that acceptable?]

Abel: [There is nothing to correct. Still, that was a tragedy of that magnitude. Considering the scale of it, it is, hard to believe that the missing person is safe――]

Emilia: [――Subaru is fine. That's for sure.]

Emilia interrupted Abel, speaking up in a low but powerful voice.

The trust in her voice made Abel's black eyes narrow through the Oni mask. Abel's eyes, tinged with deep thought, were looking for the basis of Emilia's comment.

Sure enough, Abel took a pause and then asked Emilia, "What makes you so sure?".

Abel: [You do not know the details of what transpired within the Demon City. How can you say that he survived under those circumstances, when one wrong decision can cost him his life, only to disappear? ――How can you be so sure that he would survive in that situation?]

Emilia: [――――]

So far, all Otto and the others have heard is the news of the destruction of Chaosflame and the rumor that it was caused by an extraordinary disaster.

The genuineness of Abel's words was unknown, and it was impossible to gauge the extent to which he had dramatized the facts. But Otto could be sure that it was not a meaningless bluff.

At the same time, there was a small hitch in the way he spoke.

Abel's tone was cold, but she could sense his intention to learn more about them. ――No, it was more about finding out about Subaru through Otto and the others.

He seems to think that Subaru is hiding something from him. If it is about Subaru's position within the kingdom, he could not carelessly hand over that information.

Otto: [Emily, this is…]

Emilia: [I believe in Subaru, and I believe that Subaru is going to do their best until we get there to get him. No matter how hard things are.]

Emilia answers preemptively before Otto, trying to control the conversation for the fear of leading questions. However, it is a statement of trust based on idealism, not a concrete basis.

It was not what Otto feared, nor was it what Abel wanted. So, naturally, Abel was disappointed and lowered his gaze.

Abel: [This is all wishful thinking without any persuasive evidence. Disappointing that this is your rationale.]

Emilia: [Yeah? I think it's reaaally nice and important for people to believe in me. I feel safe when I can trust someone, and it gives me strength when they trust me. Are you different?]

Abel: [After all, feelings are just feelings. It can hardly be the deciding factor beyond that.]

Emilia's eyes wavered at Abel's answer, shaking his head and closing one eye.

Otto missed the opportunity to interject, but that was enough for him to understand that the two were water and oil. In other words, the difference between Emilia, who believes in the value of the heart, and Abel, who does not.

This rift is likely to be a difference in outlook on life and is not likely to be readily bridged.

Therefore――

Abel: [――No one can say for sure whether Natsuki Subaru is alive or dead. Even though he has always avoided the possibility of death, there is no guarantee that it will be the same this time.]

That affirmation seemed to have been Abel's conclusion in this conversation.

When, Emilia heard it and her lips pursed together.

Emilia: [Do you mean Subaru――]

She quickly looked at Abel and was about to say something.

But, one girl straightened up faster than the words could continue; it was the little girl who had closed her eyes in Emilia's arms.

???: [If you need confirmation that …Subaru is alive, Betty has it, in fact.]

Emilia: [Beatrice!]

Frederica: [Sama!]

Emilia, whose eyes widened, immediately called out to her, to which Frederica hurriedly added the honorific title.

Whether or not it was enough to disguise things, Beatrice's words had a certain effect in attracting Abel's attention and the attention of others who did not know what was going on.

Abel: [Why is it that you have the certainty of Natsuki Subaru's being alive or dead?]

Beatrice: [It's a simple matter, I suppose. It's because Betty and Subaru are connected by the soul, in fact!]

Yorna: [――. Ah, so that's how it is. If this and that child are deeply connected, I can see the logic of that.]

Emilia: [Yes, they are in a contractual relationship. That's why…]

Abel: [The state of that girl in her debilitated state? That makes sense.]

Despite a lack of a clear explanation, Abel and Yorna are able to figure out the situation.

Revealing the fact that Beatrice is Spirit is not good for Otto and the others, who have entered the empire under false identities, but at least the two in question likely have already realized it.

It is hard to imagine, however, that Abel and his group, whose purpose is to rebel against the Emperor in the imperial capital, would do anything about them on the grounds that they have violated the decree of the empire.

Otto: [If you are convinced, then you understand. Since Beatrice-sama says so, we can be certain that Natsuki-san is alive somewhere in the place where he was sent to…]

Yorna: [――. Is that so? Then perhaps Tanza will be a little better off.]

Yorna's eyebrows lowered slightly as she looked down at Otto's additional words.

The whispered words were spun out, probably a person's name. Someone who lost their life from the way they spoke. ――It would seem that this, too, is not unconnected with the destruction of the Demon City.

To explore it in depth, though, one would have to be prepared to venture into Yorna's world, as it were.

Petra: [Um, can we backtrack a bit?]

Emilia: [Petra-chan.]

Frederica: [Sama!] 

Suddenly, not wanting to miss the momentary silence, Petra raised her hand and asked for the right to speak; Emilia carelessly called out to her again, and Frederica immediately came to her aid.

With Petra standing proudly beside her, she drew the attention of a group of adults who were strangers to her.

Petra: [Earlier, that Medium-chan told me that she was made tiny. Is that true?]

Medium: [Ah, yes, it's true! I used to be really tall! About the same height as that blonde boy over there… umm, no, it was about the same height as that woman!]

Garfiel: [First, why did’cha exclude my amazin’ self?

Frederica: [I know what you mean. Although, I am not too happy to hear about my height, either.]

Garfiel and Frederica, each of them in turn responded by pointing to Medium.

However, Medium's story is probably true, as no one has refuted it. It's hard to believe, but apparently, something magical happened to cause a person's body to shrink.

And that is――

Petra: [Has Subaru been made tiny, too?]

Petra asks in a serious, slightly firm voice.

That is a big question that Otto and the others cannot afford to ignore. It would be difficult enough just to meet up with Subaru, who was sent to the empire, but they were not expecting a situation in which his body would be shrunken.

Feeling like praying that he had heard wrong, Otto was convinced; however, it was that his prayer had never been and would never be fully heard.

Not knowing Otto's feelings, Medium nodded her head lightly and said, "That's right~.].

Medium: [Subaru-chin is just like me! Maybe a little smaller? Anyway, they made him so tiny! But I heard that Subaru-chin and Yorna-chan beat up Gramps together, so Subaru-chin is amazing!]

Emilia: [Yes, Subaru is amazing!]

Petra: [Yes, Medium-chan is right.]

Beatrice: [Naturally, I suppose. They are Betty’s partner, in fact!]

While the content itself is difficult to welcome, Medium's unhesitating praise is music to the ears. In fact, Emilia, Petra, and Beatrice are in a good mood after hearing the praise for Subaru.

Neither Garfiel and Frederica nor Otto feel bad. No, but when that praise is accompanied by unwelcome information, Otto is rather concerned.

Otto: [If Natsuki-san is also shrunken… I guess, he has become a child? Not tired of just dressing up as a woman, now he's becoming a child… infantilized? You are a restless person…]

Frederica: [As I said, I'm sorry for blaming Subaru-sama for having a partner, but… but I'm worried, I can't let him meet with Clind.]

Otto: [That's one thing, but I'm sure there are other concerns that are more important…]

By what means was such a phenomenon caused?

Since this event is so far removed from reality, there are concerns about whether or not it can be reversed, and if so, whether or not there will be any aftereffects. In the worst-case scenario, there is even a possibility that Subaru will return to the Kingdom of Lugunica as Emilia's knight while remaining small.

Emilia: [Well, in terms of ability, it's not much different, anyway.]

Subaru would indeed be outraged if he heard this, but if he could be located, then him accepting it would be tolerable damage.

If he can grow up properly from then on, he won't have too many problems with his relationship with Emilia, a half-elf. She would be able to wait until he gets older.

Otto: [I should not… Maybe I am a little out of my depth too.]

It seemed like the order of priorities for concern was in disarray.

For the time being, it is a setback that they could not meet up with Subaru, but thanks to Beatrice, they are now certain about his survival.

Now we should decide with Zikr and the others to search for him ――no, if the representative is Abel, they should decide if they want to continue this line of cooperation with them or not.

Garfiel: [――Beatrice-sama? What's up with that dumb look on your face?]

Otto: [――?]

With a hand on his chin, about to consider the options, Otto casually directed his attention to the words uttered by Garfiel.

Garfiel's gaze turned to Beatrice in Emilia's arms. She woke up, but wanting to avoid exhaustion, she remained in Emilia's arms, but her good mood from her earlier praise of Subaru was short-lived, and her eyes widened.

What her wavering eyes are looking at is not Medium.

Another girl, snuggled up beside her as if they were sisters. Beatrice stared at her, not even having heard her name yet.

Beatrice: [...Why are you here, I suppose.]

Louis: [Uu?]

Beatrice: [Answer, in fact! No, do not do anything unnecessary, I suppose!]

Immediately after asking the question in a trembling voice, Beatrice's voice rises as her expression changes.

At the sound, the little girl who had her head tilted, jumped in surprise, and naturally, Otto and the others were surprised by Beatrice's reaction.

Otto: [Be, Beatrice… sama, what's wrong? You suddenly yelled at that girl…]

Beatrice: [It is the reasonable thing to yell, in fact! Otto! Did you not realize it, I suppose?]

Otto: [Me? What do… ah.]

Something in the back of Otto's mind asserted itself in the face of the reprimand and his apparent bewilderment.

At first, when he saw the girl, it was a nagging feeling that had been there since the moment he saw her, but it gradually became clearer and clearer because of Beatrice's attitude.

Yes, Otto had recognized this girl. It was a sense of ――déjà vu that should not have existed in the Empire, a place he was visiting for the first time.

Otto: [Unbelievable, she is.]

Otto stared at the girl, as a startling possibility surfaced in his mind.

The possibility that floated in the air was something that seemed to be placed in the corner of Otto's hazy memory. At that time, Otto's leg had been sliced open, and he was slipping in and out of consciousness from the pain and blood loss.

So, although he didn't see clearly who it was that had done it――

Emilia: [Beatrice, Otto-kun, what is it? Both of you, are just looking at that girl…]

Confused by the reaction of Otto and Beatrice, Emilia called out to Beatrice, while no one else was able to provide an answer. Then it became unnecessary.

The reason is that there is no longer a need to keep the confusion as confusion.

Beatrice: [――It's Gluttony, in fact!]

Emilia: [Eh…]

Emilia's eyes widen at this as Beatrice speaks up in a calm, hard tone of voice.

However, it was not only Emilia who froze, but everyone else who heard her voice, and at this moment Beatrice's voice had the attention of everyone in the room.

Therefore, everyone overheard about the identity of this little girl.

Beatrice: [That girl is, the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony… a girl named Louis Arneb, I suppose.]

△▼△▼△▼△

――The moment Beatrice's words were uttered, an explosive mood took over the area.

Garfiel: [You've gotta be kiddin' me. A Sin Archbishop, what the hell do ya think you're doin'?]

Understandably, shock, horror, and confusion spread as Beatrice's words echoed.

That was what the young girl had said. Ordinarily no adult with sound judgment would accept a thing like that without hesitation. However, that was not the case for Otto and the others.

Of course Otto, who had a faint recognition of that girl's ――Louis's appearance, as well the members of the camp, who believed Beatrice would not tell a lie, immediately accepted it as a fact.

Accordingly, Garfiel had stepped forward, cracking his knuckles and baring his fangs.

Like that, Garfiel narrowed the pupils of his green eyes and glared at Louis.

Garfiel: [On top of that, it's Gluttony? Isn't that the one who's been hoggin' the top spot on our amazin’ selves’ list of bastards to beat up. Is this the Imperial Way?]

Medium: [W-Wait! That's not right! Louis-chan isn't a bad girl!]

Blocking Garfiel's view, Medium spread her arms to protect Louis.

Her wish to protect the girl behind her was commendable, but it was exceedingly unlikely that she could stop Garfiel's wrath. In the first place――,

Otto: [You say she is not a bad girl, but are you being serious? Just so you know, both of my legs were painfully gouged out by her. I still have some garish scars; should I show them to you?]

Medium: [That wasn't ...L-Louis-chan, maybe it was a different girl...]

Otto: [Sorry but, she had clearly introduced herself as such. There were victims other than me...undoubtedly, an incalculable number of them. Some were our friends, or the friends of our allies]

Medium: [B, but, but, but...]

With her eyes tearing up, Medium was desperately searching for some words of rebuttal.

However, Otto intended to shut down this war of words, whether her intelligence was as childlike as she looked, or even if only her appearance had shrunk.

In any case, there was likely no person in this world that could defend a Sin Archbishop.

Sin Archbishops and Witch Cultists were abominations of that degree.

That's why Emilia, identical in appearance to the Witch of Envy who was the cause of it all, was unable to escape ridicule for her impossible dream.

Medium: [Maybe, Louis-chan was like that before...but Louis-chan is different now!]

Garfiel: [Different from before? What the hell are ya basin' that on?]

Medium: [Because! She was friends with Big bro, Subaru-chin, and Rem-chan! I've been with her this whole time...and she hasn't done a single bad thing! She didn't!]

Otto: [――with Natsuki-san?]

Medium's desperate, futile resistance, shouting as she frantically searched for words, had hurled an unusual object into his ears that were too big to ignore.

Subaru had worked together with Louis. ――Surely it was not because he had not known who Louis was. Subaru should have quickly guessed Louis's true identity.

Petra: [Otto-san, Subaru wouldn't have lost his memory or something right?]

Otto: [For a moment, that fear passed over me, but from what I've heard from Mizelda-san and Zikr-san, I think that is barely a concern.]

To the anxious Petra's words, Otto dismissed his anxieties due to the evidence for consideration.

When it comes to the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony Louis being there, and having worked together with her, what would certainly be scary was the situation where Subaru had been robbed of his "memories.".

Since he remembered Subaru, there was probably no concern that his "name" had been eaten, but whether his "memories" had been was a question of his own subjective symptoms.

However――

Emilia: [――The stories of Subaru we've heard in this city are still of the Subaru we know. So there's no need to worry about that, Petra-chan… Petra-sama]

Petra: [Emily, thank you]

At the words of Emilia, who had reached the same conclusion, Petra also finally showed an expression of relief.

Though that was the basis for why Subaru's "memories" had not been eaten, it was difficult to say it was grounds to decide on a course of action for Louis in this place.

Of course, there was no denying the question of why Subaru had not anything about Louis one way or the other, but――

Otto: [Since it was Natsuki-san, it probably was not a matter of getting his hands on a young-looking girlfriend or something like that. ――Is it possible he was concerned about the Authority's nullification requirements?]

Emilia: [We've talked about it before. Even if we defeat the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony, we don't have any definite proof that everything that was lost would come back]

Otto: [It is troublesome, but if that's the case then it is understandable why he did not act prematurely.]

As Garfiel had said, defeating the Sin Archbishop of Gluttony was an ardent wish of Otto and the others, the Royal Candidates, and the world, that was hard to let slip.

However, this was not because of a simple desire for revenge; their first goal was the restoration of the damage Gluttony had produced.

If taking Louis's life would return the victims of her Authority to how they were before, there would not be a problem.

However, what would they do if the victims were not restored? Subaru might have been wary that if they acted prematurely, the way to return the victims to normal 

Garfiel: [――I know what you're thinking Ottobro. But that doesn't mean we hafta let the pipsqueak go free.]

Despite understanding Otto's thoughts, Garfiel had arrogantly declared that.

While the idea that taking her life would eliminate their chance was scary, it was hard to believe taking her into custody would cause any problems.

Rather, the danger of leaving a Sin Archbishop alone was likely far greater.

Therefore in times like this, Garfiel, who tended to make snap decisions, was reliable

Bit by bit, Garfiel closed the gap in order to pin down the dangerous Sin Archbishop. At Garfiel's approach, Louis shrank her small body down with a "Uu.].

Medium: [Abel-chin! Say something!]

Protecting Louis behind her and facing off against Garfiel, Medium called for Abel.

Abel, who had not interjected during this course of events, turned his gaze to Medium's complaint.

Abel: [What should I say? Handling this shall be your duty]

Medium: [But, I can't convince them well!]

Abel: [Don't foist the blame for your unworthiness on me. In the first place, it is unnecessary]

Medium's eyes wavered as she was told it was unnecessary.

Perhaps Abel's cruel language was to make her believe he had abandoned Louis. However, in truth that had not been the case.

Because Abel had said that he himself did not have to get involved.

Garfiel: [M, My amazin' self's not goin' to go easy on ya even if you're a woman]

???: [That's splendid. Otherwise, the excuse that you cut corners because I'm beautiful would end up being made.]

In front of Garfiel, who had stopped walking, Yorna had stepped in and stood relaxedly.

Wearing thick soles on top of being tall, to begin with, Yorna looked down on Garfiel, kiseru in hand. Returning her gaze head-on, Garfiel fiercely bared his fangs.

Yorna would defend Louis, and had declared her intention to do so.

Since she had originally come to Guaral from the Demon City with Louis, they had known she had no intention of getting rid of her, but that was hard to believe.

Otto: [I will say it again, but she is a Sin Archbishop. Surely you're not saying that the horrors of the Witch Cult are not known in the Vollachian Empire?]

Yorna: [We know the deeds of those ruffians, and their repulsiveness. Naturally, we also know the malice of those calling themselves Sin Archbishops]

Otto: [I hear the wounds of the Fortress City of Garkla still have not healed]

The large Imperial city had been destroyed in a rampage of Greed, a Sin Archbishop of the Witch Cult.

The offender, Greed, was defeated in Pristella, but it was common knowledge that one could not choose where the Witch Cult would rampage. Naturally, in the Empire as well.

In spite of that, the fact was that they had left Louis to run wild.

Otto: [Do you think you can tame them? I have to say that is imprudent]

Abel: [If something is useful, I shall consider how to use it. It is you people that are severely mistaken in thinking that everything would take your side]

Otto: [――――]

Abel had dodged Otto's questioning, and effortlessly pointed that out condescendingly.

Of course, there were those who let out disgust and hostility upon hearing that Louis was a Sin Archbishop. However, like Medium and Yorna, many of them were reluctant to get rid of Louis.

In particular――

Mizelda: [――I'll say this, Subaru and Rem were both our friends. Since they were the ones who brought Louis with them, they are the only two who have the right to decide Louis's fate]

Frederica: [Mizelda-sama...]

Mizelda: [Of course, if the Chieftain disagrees, then I will yield]

With eyes conveying a strong sense of purpose, and having cast a piercing gaze that way, Mizelda would try to take the side protecting Louis. Frederica, who had had many opportunities to exchange words with her at City Hall, gasped under that strong gaze.

Mizelda was the representative of the Shudraq, and the other Shudraqians would follow her. ――No, more accurately, they would follow the Chieftain who had returned to the city.

The target of Mizelda's words and gaze was the woman dressed formally in black, who had been entrusted with the decision. Taritta, the new Chieftain of the Shudraq had been asked by her older sister, "What should we do?]

Taritta: [My opinion is the same as Sister's. However, this decision wasn't because Sister said so, as I am protecting Louis for my own reasons. Since, I owe Louis a debt of gratitude]

Mizelda: [Ha, is that so?]

At Taritta's clear answer, Mizelda relaxed her lips and nodded.

They did not know what these sisters' relationship was like, but it seemed like Mizelda had happily accepted Taritta's opinion.

However, Otto and the others did not have the luxury of considering that heartwarming.

Beatrice: [A Sin Archbishop, on top of that Gluttony, such a thing cannot be overlooked, in fact. Will you all calm down, I suppose]

From within Emilia's arms, Beatrice's words were filled with strength.

She had come this far by suppressing her exhaustion, but in an emergency, it was necessary for her to display her abilities. Like Subaru, not hesitating when one occurred was a bad habit of Beatrice's.

Emilia: [That's no good, everyone calm down! Fighting like this――]

While the spirits of Beatrice and Garfiel, and those of Yorna and the Shudraq, had risen in preparation for battle, Emilia tried to stop the dispute with a heartbroken look on her face.

In fact, if it came to seriously stopping the dispute through brute force, Emilia was the one with the ability best suited for doing so.

If she were to use her immense mana to freeze Guaral, Otto would aim to secure Louis in the meantime. At worst, they would cut ties with everyone in Guaral.

Otto: [Rather than risk letting Sin Archbishop go――]

And so it was as Otto was preparing to make his move.

???: [――What is the matter, you plebeians, have you not yet fought enough? That is quite hot-blooded, is it not.]

Otto: [――――]

Suddenly, a powerful new voice shook the air in that large chamber of City Hall.

It belonged to a woman whose shoes clacked loudly as she leisurely came up the stairs. Some time ago, Otto had said that Emilia, Abel, and Yorna had presences that were impossible to ignore, but the person whose voice that was, gave an impression that did not match the atmosphere that enveloped them.

A beautiful woman slowly appeared with the hem of her blood-red dress swaying.

She had fair skin and orange hair, and had boldly adorned herself with numerous ornaments, but even the glitter of those jewels lost out to her natural beauty――Priscilla Barielle.

In this Fortress City of Guaral, the final person who held a voice of influence had appeared.

Following behind her as she walked unhurriedly, was her attendant Schult, whose small, humble movements caught the eye, as well as Al, with his unforgettably eccentric appearance.

Together with Abel, Medium, and the others, Al was also one of the people who had headed to Chaosflame with Subaru. Right after returning, he had gone to meet up with Priscilla, and now it seemed they were coming up together.

Originally there was supposed to be one more person, Heinkel, who could not be seen, but that was a minor thing.

More importantly, from Otto's point of view, a being had joined in who seemed like she would make this explosive atmosphere even worse.

Fickle and powerful, Priscilla was an existence for which it was impossible to predict what side she would choose.

Rather, it seemed likely that it would be better if they could declare her an enemy.

Priscilla: [I showed up after hearing that Abel and the others had returned, but I had not expected this kind of atmosphere so quickly. Even if the city is this devastated, it seems a starved dog cannot choose where it barks.]

Emilia: [Priscilla! Everyone is reaaally tense right now. Don't say strange things]

Priscilla: [Nonsense. If I had not come, you would have made it snow once again. Let me tell you, no matter how cold you make it, I shall not stop baring my shoulders. However, cold is cold.]

Emilia: [I'm sorry about that but...]

Emilia had an absurd exchange with Priscilla as she entered, then apologized.

However, the reason the end of that sentence had lost its strength, was not because Emilia had reconsidered.

It was because the high-pitched sound of a hard object falling had reverberated throughout the large chamber.

Medium: [――Yorna-chan?]

Suddenly, Medium looks up at the woman standing just in front of her, turning her head and muttering to herself. Under Yorna's feet, staring into her blue eyes, a single kiseru fell.

Yorna was fiddling with it in her hands, a rare masterpiece that was not cheap.

Louis: [Uu.]

With a groan, Louis, who is at the center of the conversation, picks up the fallen kiseru. However, Yorna does not accept the picked-up kiseru when it is offered to her.

Instead, Yorna's gaze was solely on Priscilla, the presence that had just set foot into the Great hall.

Staring at Priscilla, Yorna's eyes widened.

Yorna, who gives the impression that she is calm and unperturbed, is astonished.

Her crimson lips were opened with a gentle touch.

Yorna: [Pr, Prisca…?]

Yes, they called Priscilla. ――a different name that didn't sound familiar to them.

Yorna, whose eyes widened in stiff surprise at the similar but different name, addressed Priscilla. There were three people present who responded to the name.

One is Zikr, another is Abel, and the last one, needless to say, is Priscilla.

Zikr looks at Yorna speculatively, Abel contemplatively, and Priscilla scornfully.

Priscilla: [What, you, why do you behave like that towards me …no.

Priscilla looks back at Yorna with her crimson eyes, trying not to hide her displeasure.

As Priscilla stared at Yorna, her sharp tongue seemed ready to strike her, but was cut off just before she did.

Yorna's blue eyes and Priscilla's blood-colored eyes stared at each other, and a moment of silence passed.

Then Priscilla let out an "Ahh" like an exhale

Priscilla: [――Who would have thought it would be you, dear mother?]

With that, a remark causing another explosion different from that of the already volatile situation, was indifferently declared.
