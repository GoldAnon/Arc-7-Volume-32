*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――The siege of the Imperial Capital of Lupugana had begun with a fierce battle that neither side would willingly give up.

By all rights, there was no necessity for Emilia and the others to take part in this conflict that could be called an all-out war between the rebels, who bore discontent against the current Vollachia, and the nation's military, who were trying to protect these peaceful times.

Originally, the reason Emilia's party entered the Empire was for the sake of the people they were searching for.

Of course, they had compassion for and a sense of duty to the people they had met on their travels after successfully smuggling themselves into Vollachia.

There were people that wanted to be happy without the borders of the countries of The Kingdom and the Empire, and even those they could wish to lend their strength to. Everyone in the party agreed on that.

However, even Emilia's party, an unmistakably soft-hearted group, had priorities.

Ignoring their original objective would be getting their priorities backward. The party had people (Otto, Petra) with the judgment to admonish the ones（Emilia, Garfiel) whose conscience made them reflexively try to save others.

The reason they took part in the battle of the Fortress City, which had turned hellish after being attacked by flying dragons, was purely because the friends they were searching for had been sighted in that city, and they had been pursuing that information.

Since things had gone contrary to their expectations, if they had abided by that reasoning, there was no reason for Emilia and the others to join in on the rebel army's attack on the Imperial Capital.

In fact, even as they heard about the Empire's state of affairs, with the scent of burning growing day after day, Emilia and the others had hardened their resolve, resulting in their sense of purpose is only minimally shaken.

That was not supposed to――,

???: [――Since the one who abducted that girl was "The Flying Dragon General," she is likely located in the Dragonkin Madelyn Eschart's residence, the mansion of her owner.]

Positioned in front of a map spread in a room on the topmost floor of the Fortress City's City Hall, Abel had answered Emilia's question while touching the Oni mask that concealed his face.

Hearing Abel's answer, Emilia muttered, "Madelyn's owner..."

――The time was a few days before the siege of the Imperial Capital of Lupugana.

With their hopes dashed of uniting with Subaru, who should have returned to Guaral after heading to the Demon City, and having just missed Rem, who had woken up, Emilia and the others had been unsure as to what plan they should follow from then on.

They wondered whether they should prioritize the search for Subaru, whose whereabouts were completely unknown after the collapse of the Demon City of Chaosflame, or Rem, for whom they only knew her abductor's identity.

The opening words had been what Abel told Emilia, who wanted some basis for making the decision.

Abel: [It was unlikely that wild-tempered Dragonkin made him ask, but she was a General First-Class recommended by Prime Minister Berstetz Fondalfon. If anything were to happen, she should return to his side.]

Emilia: [――――]

Abel: [What? Do you also have doubts?]

Emilia: [No, it's not that...I just thought "owner" was reaaally not a nice way of putting it.]

She had not exchanged many words with Madelyn, and instead, they had fought violently, but she had thought that Madelyn would get extremely angry if she heard the way Abel had just put it.

Remaining silent at what Emilia had pointed out, Abel narrowed his eyes behind his mask. She hoped he would reflect on his statement and recognize that it had not been nice.

In any case, Abel's knowledgeable opinion was helpful for the circumstances of the Imperial side, which Emilia and the others had not known.

An air of rebellion had risen all over the Empire, and the sense that the look of the sky and dryness of the air had worsened had not brought good premonitions to Emilia either, who wanted to think things over as much as possible.

Since they had failed to meet the people they were looking for at every chance they had, their luck in the Empire had been poor.

Emilia: [But, if Madelyn went back to that Berstetz guy, then Rem also...]

???: [If Rem-chan's there, then so is Big bro!]

Emilia retraced the flow of the conversation, and Medium, who had clung onto the operations desk there, joined in.

Emilia's lips relaxed as her eyes met Medium's, who had stretched her small body to its fullest. With Rem, her precious brother had also been one of the people Madelyn took.

Medium, surely very anxious and worried, did not show the slightest weakness.

That undauntedness made Emilia think she, too, needed to learn from that example.

???: [Prime Minister-san...Berstetz Fondalfon-sama is a very talented and capable man, said to be the keystone of the Empire, isn't he?]

Beside Emilia, who had been struck by Medium's courageousness, it had been Petra who interjected like that.

Unable to let Emilia go alone, Petra had kept close and came along with her. Putting a finger to her lips, Emilia murmured, "Is that so?" and tilted her head.

Emilia: [The keystone of the Empire is a reaaally impressive evaluation, but isn't that the Emperor?]

Petra: [Of course, I think The Empire always being peaceful was because of the capabilities of His Excellency the Emperor. However, His Excellency the Emperor's capabilities also include making good use of his talented subordinates.]

Emilia: [Ah, that's right. Even if the Emperor is reaaally strong and reaaally smart, that doesn't mean he can do everything all by himself.]

Even Emilia, who was earnestly working hard, did not think she saw things the same way as Vollachia's Emperor. However, since she eventually needed to be able to see things the same way, she had to work hard like that.

However, no matter how hard she worked, Emilia would surely always be asking for everyone's help.

That should have been the same for the Emperor of Vollachia too.

However, while Emilia and Medium were impressed, Abel seemed to harbor a completely different impression. His gaze sharpened through his Oni mask and pierced Petra.

Abel: [What is it that you want to do by going out of your to make me listen to this exceeding obvious rationale? Do you think there is room to listen to the words of a young child? This time is already being mourned.]

Petra: [My apologies, that was roundabout. I just wanted to ask you this. ――If he is His Excellency the Emperor's important right-hand man, then Prime Minister-san's residence is in the Imperial Capital, right?]

Abel: [――――]

Petra was not afraid of that sharp gaze, and Abel remained silent at her question.

Abel's scary gaze should have felt like having a blade pointed at her, but Petra had not wavered in the slightest. That was how strong Petra's true feelings were.

That was enough to make her campmate, Emilia, want to puff out her chest proudly.

Abel: [The answer to your question is affirmed. Inevitably, both of the individuals taken by Madelyn Eschart, …Rem and Flop O'Connell, should also be under the care of Berstetz in the Imperial Capital.]

Abel responded in a low voice, as if he was overwhelmed by Petra's gaze. Emilia was about to praise Petra for her words.

But, Petra's expression wasn't good; on the contrary, she sighed visibly and,

Petra: [...It's like we are being manipulated, and it's not funny.]

Emilia: [Huh? What do you mean by that?]

Unsure of the meaning of Petra's response, Emilia blinks her eyes. In response to Emilia's words, Petra's voice dropped in tone with a sour look on her face.

Petra: [We have nothing to do with the problems unfolding within the empire. I know that there is going to be a very large battle, and I am worried about Medium-chan and Utakata-chan, but…]

Emilia: [――. Yeah, it's okay. I know exactly what you mean. We came looking for both Subaru and Rem.]

Preempting Petra's difficult words, Emilia chooses her words gently.

She understood Petra's fears and concerns. After all, Emilia, if nothing else, would like to continue to work with Abel and the others on the sly as she wanted to help everyone she knew.

However, if they only focused on immediate problems like that, they would never get to Subaru and Rem, which was their original goal――,

Emilia: [Huh?]

After thinking that far, Emilia got stuck in her own head.

As she answered Petra, Emilia remembered her team's goal which was to bring Subaru and Rem back safely. So even though it was painful, they must pass by the battle going on in Vollachia unnoticed.

She thought so, but.

Petra: [But Rem might be in the Imperial Capital now. So then…]

Emilia: [――We have to go to the Imperial Capital too.]

The icy doubts that Emilia had, started to melt away, and her eyes met Petra's on the other side of the ice.

Petra had a very bitter look on her face because she was the first to realize that fact. To confirm Emilia's surprise, Petra glared at Abel.

And――,

Petra: [It’s not fair. You were silent until we said it ourselves.]

It is a principle that naturally leads to one conclusion if you think it through. It would be arrogant of you to call me despicable while putting on a shelf the poor circulation of your blood.

Petra: [So please tell us. You mentioned that there are two places for Madelyn, the "Flying Dragon General," to return to the Prime Minister's residence in the Imperial Capital and another one. But you only talked about the Imperial Capital, so that Emily would not pay attention to the other one.]

Abel: [――――]

Petra: [Taking advantage of someone's ignorance is called shameless where I come from.]

With a sting, Petra glared at Abel accusingly. As Petra spoke, Emilia, who had been deceived by the missing information, lowered her eyebrows.

On Abel's side, too, Medium, peering at the map next to him, looked up to note his methods, "Abel-chin…"

She reflected on it very much. At the same time, Emilia understood why Petra was angry.

Aside from the concealment of information, Abel was right that Emilia could have noticed it if she thought it through without being told in advance.

Of course, Emilia did not intend to rely on others in all matters.

Emilia: [Abel said you said you didn't have time. That's true for both of us, but you don't have to be mean about it.]

Abel: [That's just what your Pride makes you say. Why should I go to the trouble of explaining to you in detail why things are the way they are?]

Emilia: [――? If you want our help, you will have to say please.]

Abel: [――. A woman who does not mix well.]

Crossing his thin arms, Abel exhales a long, heavy breath.

However, in response, Emilia asked, "Is that so?" and had a completely different opinion. It is not that they didn't mesh, but that Abel didn't want to mesh.

Emilia: [Isn't that right? Because if you're about to fight the hardest battle in Vollachia, you're going to need our help. We are Reaaally strong.]

Petra: [Emily, it is a little worrisome how you say that.]

Emilia: [We are reaaally reliable!]

Petra: [We are reliable. Especially Emily, and Garf-san.]

Emilia rephrased her statement, and Petra, next to her, also spoke so and puffed out her chest.

As for Emilia's group ――Garfiel is an unquestionably strong fighter, and Emilia is quite self-confident; Otto and Petra are very smart, and Frederica has always been a master of care.

Beatrice, who could not afford to strain herself until she is reunited with Subaru, is sleeping on the sidelines, but the thought of having to protect her fills her with renewed strength.

That's why――,

Emilia: "It would definitely be easier to fulfill Abel's goals if we were here, right? And yet you are only talking like that because you don't want us to think you are asking us to help you?"

Abel: [――――]

Emilia: [Roswaal is also not very good at saying please…]

Abel, like Roswaal, probably has a personality that does not want to show weakness to his opponents.

Because of this, they try to get the other person to say something instead of themselves. Perhaps that's how things have always worked out.

Emilia: [I think you should stop before you get Reaaally beat up like Roswaal by Medium-chan, Yorna, Zikr-san, and others]

When he was involved in a devious scheme involving the mansion and the "Sanctuary," Roswaal received a slap on the face from everyone, including Emilia.

Emilia, who participated in the event, said it was very painful. Since Roswaal was only disciplined, he only suffered a swollen face, but with Abel, who knows what could happen?

That is, notwithstanding the concern for Abel's well-being.

Emilia: [Is what I'm saying totally off the mark? If so, I'm embarrassed, please say so. Then I'll apologize and think of something else.]

Abel: [Something else?]

Emilia: [I don't think of you as someone who can't think ahead, who can't think about everything. It's important to keep thinking about what you're thinking about.]

Previously, Emilia was quick to give up on things she didn't understand.

She was quick to blame it on something, give up, and naively assume that doing what Puck says is the right thing to do. Lately, she has been enlisting help from others who are good at thinking, like Ram and Otto.

But it shouldn't be like that, where the people you rely on just change.

Petra mentioned that the emperor of Vollachia was very good at using people. But even an emperor who was good at using people would have had to think about what he would use them for.

And those in important positions, those who are at the center of everyone else's lives, must be able to do that.

That is what Emilia has chosen to work toward.

???: [――I am pleased to hear your very encouraging thoughts, Emily.]

A voice from behind complimented Emilia, who was facing sharply toward Abel. The voice is familiar even without turning around, and its owner is the ever-reliable Otto.

He was on a different mission to investigate something, but he probably had something to do with Abel, not here at city hall.

Emilia: [Otto-kun, did you have business with Abel, too? Are you okay on your own?]

Otto: [Thank you for your concern. But you do not need to worry so much…]

Emilia: [Yeah? But, Otto-kun, there was a time when you were kidnapped while we all weren't keeping an eye on you…]

Otto: [I can’t deny that! …Well, I was prepared for it, too]

Otto's voice rises at Emilia's concern, and Garfiel appears right behind him, apparently following Otto's investigations.

Relieved, Emilia patted her chest,

Emilia: [Thanks, Garfiel.]

Garfiel: [Ha, I don't need to be thanked for that. What were Emily and Lady Petra talkin’ about?

Emilia: [Well, many things, …but thanks to Lady Petra, I wasn't persuaded. I wasn't persuaded, was I?]

Petra: [Yes, everything's fine, Emily. I was very surprised at how reliable you were.]

Emilia: [Hehe, isn’t that right?]

Emilia and Petra high-fived in front of Otto and the others, who, like Garfiel, had worked so hard to protect Petra, making it worth it.

As Otto lowered the corners of his eyes at the sight of the two, he and the oni-masked "Abel-san" turned to face each other across the strategy desk.

Otto: [I can imagine what you were talking about with Emily and the others, about how Rem was taken by a member of the Nine Divine Generals and that Rupgana, the capital of the empire, is the place where they are going, and that we are already in a position to become enemies of the empire, or something like that. Isn't that the story?]

Emilia: [――! Amazing! Otto-kun, did you secretly listen to us?]

Petra: [Eavesdropping?]

Otto: [Aside from Emily, and even Lady Petra, …there is no way I am eavesdropping!]

Emilia: [Sure. Then I guess you're still amazing.]

Petra: [...You really weren't eavesdropping, Garf-san?]

Garfiel: [Aside from Emily, Lady Petra is…]

Emilia is impressed, and Petra confirms the truth with Garfiel, and while smiling at the two extreme reactions, Otto, who guessed the conversation just before, clears his throat.

Then turning his now fading playful eyes to Abel, he said

Otto: [I have just been listening to the people who have come to town from out of town. It's the same with the voices of rebellion in many places, but they come here one after another.]

Abel: [It is no surprise, given the circumstances and the fact that The Flying Dragon General has retreated, and that Yorna Mishigure has taken the residents of Demon City with her and has made this her new base.]

Otto: [Yes, That is right. ――It is excellent handiwork.]

Abel responds to Otto's nodding with a curt response.

The content of the exchange itself was something that Emilia already knew. In the past few days, people have been gathering in Guaral, and Emilia has been lending a hand in repairing the broken housing.

However, Frederica and Petra cautioned her not to do too much heavy lifting, so her role is solely to participate in repairing supports by magically freezing them.

Anyway, there was nothing new in the content. Still, what Emilia found modestly disconcerting was perhaps Otto's attitude.

As usual, Otto is quiet, smart, and dependable ――but what Emilia felt in his soft demeanor seemed to be a hidden but not fully concealed anger.

Otto: [How far did you go with the planning?]

Abel: [――――]

It was these words that confirmed Emilia's suspicions.

Abel is silent in response to Otto's question. But Emilia took it as a pause; this was not because he was thinking of an answer, but to hurry the other party along.

Because Abel's gaze never wavered and his eyes never changed. The answer was already decided, but he was only too pompous to let them hear it.

Otto: [I wonder how far you're willing to go.]

Again, Otto asked the same thing, but in a different way.

 It is not that they were rushed, and they do not seem to have lost their patience. While she doesn't like to talk about winners and losers, in this situation, the winners and losers have already been decided.

Otto's attitude was to ask why he lost, and that his defeat was not a surprise to Emilia and the others; it was the same question.

Abel: [――I only learned of your existence when I returned to this city. If you want me to include you in the plan, you will have to start by imitating gazing the stars.]

Otto: [So, you think this is just a coincidence?]

Abel: [I am not going to dismiss it as a coincidence. After all, fortune itself is only one of the end factors.]

Shaking his head once from side to side, Abel categorically denied Otto's words.

Seeing Otto's cheeks harden at her words, Emilia couldn't resist pulling on his sleeve. And end his feeling of defeat, the feeling of being left to bear it all alone.

Emilia: [Otto-kun, what does this mean?]

Otto: [...Just now, there was a report about Natsuki-san's situation. I thought it was quite the  ridiculous event.]

Petra: [It's just like Medium-chan; he's smaller, right?]

Hearing Otto's story, Petra glances at Medium, standing next to Abel.

Medium spoke of being attacked by an enemy in the Demon City and being turned from an adult into a child; she said that not only she, but also Subaru, is in a similar situation.

Further, in order to protect Subaru in such an uncertain state,

Emilia: [Abel must have spread those rumors that the boy with black hair and black eyes was the emperor's child. That way, if people discovered Subaru who thought badly of him...]

Otto: [To be sure of the truth of the matter, his life would not be taken. I thought it was an ingenious idea at the time, as well. Anyway, if Natsuki-san's level of danger would be lowered,  However――]

Garfiel: [Anyway, it seems that it ain’t no longer just a matter of safety for the captain.]

Garfiel crossed his arms and spoke up, referring back to Otto's statement. Emilia turns around with a "huh?" as Garfiel clicks his sharp fangs.

Garfiel: [There's lotta people comin’ into the city, and they're all tryin’ to fight the emperor. My amazin’ self got nothin’ to say about that. But if the captain is in danger, that's somethin’ else.

Emilia: [Subaru is in danger…]

Petra: [...I see; that's how it is.]

Emilia's eyebrows rose, and beside her, Petra muttered as if she had noticed something. Then she sharpened her round eyes and glared at Abel, as Otto had done before.

Petra: [A boy with black hair and black eyes …whether he is the real illegitimate son of the emperor or not, they don't know, but the soldiers can't afford to overlook him.]

Emilia: [Yes, yes, I know. So, Subaru is safe and…]

Petra: [But they are only safe until they are sure that the boy is legitimate. So, where do you go to verify if the boy is legitimate or not?]

Emilia: [Where do… ah.]

After listening to Petra as she organized her thoughts, Emilia finally caught on to the main points.

Subaru has become a child ――a boy with black hair, and black eyes is being sought after as a result of a rumor spread by Abel, and any children found are brought in to see if they are legitimate or not.

The place, of course, was――,

Emilia: [――The imperial capital, where the emperor is?]

Abel: [Not surprisingly, both of the things you are looking for are in the Imperial City. You have saved me a great deal of trouble.]

Petra: [How disingenuous…]

When Emilia arrived at her conclusion, Abel nodded deeply, as if he had been expecting it. Immediately, Petra raised her voice at Abel and strongly denounced his attitude.

But Abel, for his part, shrugged his shoulders at Petra's anger.

Abel: [I should have told you. Your existence is not something I expected. It was merely a rumor that I spread in order to fan the flames of the rebels' existence, and thus it has performed its function.]

Petra: [――hk.]

Abel: [Or else, what shall you say? After deliberately shrinking Natsuki Subaru and making him disappear, I spread rumors to mislead the entire empire, and incidentally had one of the "Nine Divine Generals" kidnap that Oni girl, who could use healing arts, as well. That I had orchestrated all of it. ――I must be a busy man.]

Petra's expression stiffened as he spoke to her as if mocking her.

Of course, neither Otto nor Garfiel were pleased to have Petra treated that way. So Abel should be relieved that it was Emilia who made the first move.

Emilia steps forward to protect Petra and stares at Abel with her arms crossed.

Emilia: [I don't think of you as someone who knows everything about everything. Don't bully Lady Petra with weird ways of saying things. If you do it again…]

Abel: [What if I do it again?]

Emilia: [I'm going to be the first one to make good on what we talked about earlier!]

Emilia says this with her clenched fist out in front of her.

Emilia, too, believes that everything should be resolved through dialogue, if possible, but if someone just won't listen or can't understand something, a clenched fist is always an option.

Especially if it is not Emilia who had been wronged, but rather a valued member of her camp.

Abel: [――. Socially Incognizant. Is this always the case with the leaders among you?]

Otto: [Yes, I do often have a hard time picking the right words. But――]

Garfiel: [That's the kind of guy that makes it all worthwhile. It's a lot better than some asshole who thinks he can walk on the same path if he just blocks the way and restricts it with logic.]

Abel's eyes narrowed, and Otto and Garfiel each responded in kind.

Somehow, Emilia felt that the topic that was being discussed was about her, not Petra, who was supposed to be their provisional representative, but Emilia did not press that point too deeply.

Now, they all had to defend Petra and talk about――,

Garfiel: [In other words, it's possible that both Rem and the captain, could be in the Imperial Capital.

Otto: [And since there is a strong possibility that the decisive battle between the regular army and the rebels will be in the Imperial Capital, we have no choice but to take unorthodox approaches.]

Petra: [Shameless…]

Subaru and Rem may also be in the Imperial Capital of Lupugana.

Maybe Rem is in a different location than he is, with Subaru being brought together with the black-haired boys in the imperial capital, or maybe this is just being very hopeful.

Even so, if that's the most likely scenario, everyone is right.

Emilia: [I've decided. Let's all of us go to the Imperial Capital, we have to find Subaru and Rem.]

Otto: [Emily, The decision is reserved for Lady Petra.]

Emilia: [Oh, of course! Um, what do you say, Lady Petra? Are you willing to go along with what I've decided?]

Petra: [――. Yes, it's okay, Emily. The truth is, I do not like the fact that it seems like everything is going to go that guy's way.]

With a fixed stare, Petra glares at Abel, yet quickly softens her expression.

She was willing to take the frustration of Abel's outburst on behalf of Subaru and the others. Petra's concern was appreciated, and Emilia turned to Abel and said, "Yes, that's right,"

Emilia: [Hey, Abel, Lady Petra said everything was exactly as you wanted it to be…]

Abel: [I told you. It is impossible for me to control and guide everything. Or do you, like that girl, consider me an extraordinary being?]

Emilia: [No, I don't think that. I think Abel is a smart guy who wears a funny mask, and …I think he's a klutz too.]

Putting a finger to her lips, Emilia replied, while tilting her head.

When she mentioned the mask, Abel's hand gently touched the Oni mask, and right behind him, Otto, Garfiel, and Petra could also be heard laughing quietly.

She was pleased with the three's reaction, and Abel asked, "What sort of evaluation is that?"

Abel: [I have never heard of that assessment. Why are you evaluating me like that?]

Emilia: [Klutzy? well, the reason I thought that was …Yeah! I meant Subaru.]

Petra: [Is it Subaru's? What do you mean?]

Petra's eyes widen as Emilia searches for the path her thoughts have taken for a moment.

Petra, who sees Abel as a master of subterfuge, may not quite understand what Emilia meant; Emilia, too, thinks Abel is a master of subterfuge――

Emilia: [That's what Abel said, right? That it was pleasantly unexpected for him to have us.]

Abel: [Do not embellish my words.]

Emilia: [It's true that you would be better off if we were here, right? Abel never once said that it wasn't. So let's get back to that, shall we?]

Abel: [――――]

Emilia: [It's not planned for us to be there, but Abel's rumor of the black-haired boy for Subaru was planned …and if that makes it more likely that Subaru might be in the Imperial City, then that's what Abel has planned for us, right?]

Planned versus unplanned, Emilia said it so many times that it nearly confused her thoughts, but she chose her words carefully and organized them to try to make Abel's thoughts sound right.

Even without Emilia and the others, he lied about the emperor's child cooperating with the rebels. By doing so, there are less dangerous situations for Subaru as a child, and if anyone catches him, he would be brought to the imperial capital to find out if the lie is true――,

Emilia: [The lie Abel told was a lie in order to make it a little more likely that Subaru would be there when we all fight in the Imperial City …Isn't it?]

Garfiel: [――Hk, that may be so, but why did that guy have to be the captain?]

Emilia: [That's obvious. ――Because Subaru is reaaally reliable!]

It is difficult for Emilia alone to decipher the various speculations about which is for what or what purpose. But the answer to the question Garfiel mentioned is obvious.

Abel's many devious plans were designed to bring Subaru to the scene of the decisive battle.

It would indeed be very bad luck if his preparations were made so that he would not be discovered.

But even if it were――,

Emilia: [If you had asked for help, I'm sure Subaru would have listened to you.]

Rather than trying to manipulate someone, it may be more difficult to say the word "please" at times. Emilia has never thought about manipulating anyone, so she is unsure, but there are times when she cannot say please.

And how much can we reduce the number of situations in which one cannot say "please"? How much can one rely on the other party to say "please"?

It was Emilia's goal now to be able to draw that line properly within herself.

Emilia: [――――]

Emilia looks at Abel, waiting for his answer.

On the other side of the Oni mask, Emilia suddenly realized as their black and amethyst eyes collided with each other. ――Abel never blinked both of his eyes together.

One of his eyes is constantly open. She wondered if his eyes would become dry.

――She wondered if she could push herself that hard and not dry out her heart.

Abel: [What, what are you waiting for?]

Emilia: [Huh?]

Abel: [Where is my reason for responding to your incoherent babble about this and that? Do not expect this whimsy to last forever.]

???: [Abel-chin!]

Abel was about to end the conversation after a long period of silence. Emilia's eyes widened at the way in which he spoke, but it was Medium who raised her voice instead.

She watched the conversation silently, tugging at Abel's sleeve beside her.

Medium: [That was so uncool just now! Even from my point of view, you lost, Abel-chin!]

Abel: [I do not recall making this a competition to see who will win or lose. Do not pull on my sleeves. There is no replacement.]

Medium: [When you run out of clothes, dress up as a girl again! It suits you, Abel-chin!]

Brusquely, she tugged hard once more on his sleeve, and then Medium stuck her tongue out at Abel. She quickly walked around the strategy desk and approached Emilia and the others.

Medium: [I don't know anything complicated either. But if Rem-chan is in the capital, I'm sure Big bro is there too. …I want to see them again, and Subaru-chin too! That’s why, That’s why, That’s why…]

With stuttering sincerity, Medium bowed her head with a jerk. Her long golden hair fell over her head as if cast, and fell at the feet of Emilia and the others.

However, Medium is oblivious to such things.

Medium: [Please! I know Abel-chin is like that, but Emily-chan and the others can help!]

Trying her best, Medium's voice trembled as she spoke.

At her pleading, Emilia involuntarily narrowed her eyes. Then she looks over to Abel, standing beyond the bowing Medium.

Emilia: [Abel, I think it's like this.]

At Emilia's prompting, Abel looks at Medium's back as she bows her head. Then, without letting his black eyes show what he was thinking behind the Oni mask,

Abel: [You shall also join the attack on the Imperial City. I regard this as a statement of intent.]

Petra: [Shameless!]

Medium: [Abel-chin――!]

And the angry voices of the two young girls scolded Abel, who could not say please.

△▼△▼△▼△

――With that interlude, Emilia's party had decided to take part in the decisive battle of the Imperial Capital.

In truth, they did not know how far Abel had calculated and set up the board.

Perhaps, just like he told Petra, everything about Subaru and Rem was completely according to Abel's calculations, or maybe in truth, everything had been a coincidence.

If there was one thing they could say,

Otto: [Without getting too caught up in Abel-san's statements and presence, let us carry out our own objectives.]

Petra: [Yes, I also think it's best to do as Otto-san said...Who's Dudley?]

Otto:  [For the time being, an acquaintance who had also been a small goal over there...It seems they were able to join up with High Countess Dracroy, and apparently, the aforementioned High Countess was eager to rebel.]

Petra: [Then, that High Countess and Dudley ...Is Roswaal also going to the Imperial Capital?]

Otto: [That seems to be what is happening. ――I'm getting more and more discouraged.]

It seemed Roswaal, who acted independently from Emilia and the others and visited an acquaintance that was in the Vollachian Empire, had also been torn between successes and problems over there.

However, it seemed like both Roswaal and Ram would also apparently be heading to the Imperial Capital of Lupugana.

If Subaru and Rem truly were in the Imperial Capital, everyone would end up gathered there at once.

Frederica: [However, what awaits us on our way there is the center of a great rebellion that has engulfed the entire empire... and to be honest, the situation has completely changed from what we had originally envisioned.]

Garfiel: [Hey, big sis. Don’t tell me you’re scared now?]

Frederica: [I'm not frightened, but I am a little worried. It is a problem to interfere in the quarrels of other countries, and when it comes to the battlefield...]

Frederica, her eyes downcast, her expression hardened, and she hesitated to say anything beyond that.

What she did not want to say, which everyone around her could imagine―― if their destination were the decisive battle in the Imperial Capital, there would be a lot of damage to both parties.

The inevitable great swelling, which should have been an event in a neighboring country.

Petra: [Frederica nee-sama, I am glad you are concerned about me. But…]

Frederica: [Of course I am worried about Petra, but I am afraid for myself. I am sorry; it is because I am a coward.]

Petra: [nee-sama…]

Frederica shook her head steadfastly, and Petra hung her head at that compassion-filled voice..

It was likely a battle where many people would be hurt or even lose their lives, and Frederica's apprehension about taking Petra to such a place was understandable..

That anxiety and reluctance were there for everyone, not just Frederica.

That’s why――,

Emilia: [If we weren't in the empire, we would have just dismissed this as something that happened in a neighboring country, just wrinkling our brows like that. But]

Garfiel: [But?]

Emilia: [We're here and we've gotten to know the people who are going to join the fight, so even if we can get away from here, it won't be enough just to wrinkle our brows anymore.]

Even if the lives to be destroyed were the same, the feeling was different between a person you know and someone you don't know.

Life was very important and cannot be compared to anything else. So if life could be compared, it would only be with another life as well. ――this was surely a very self-righteous way of thinking.

However, if they were prepared to follow their selfish ideas, then it was already decided.

Emilia: [If we participate, I think we can reduce the number of casualties.]

Otto: [Emily… No, Emilia-sama. That is quite a thorny path.]

In response to Emilia's words, who put her hand on her chest, Otto corrected what he called her and said those words.

Otto, who had stubbornly used a pseudonym to avoid misnaming even in a place where there was no one but friends around, gave them a glimpse of his seriousness.

It would be rude not to respond to that seriousness, so Emilia nodded seriously.

Emilia: [Hmm, I know. No, maybe Otto-kun is finding it a lot more difficult than I think, but I'll take care of that too.]

Otto: [Our goal is to bring back Natsuki-san and Rem-san. If only two people die in this decisive battle, and those two people are Natsuki-san and Rem-san, we have failed. Conversely, if the people of the empire are annihilated, but the two are safe, we win.]

Garfiel: [Ottobro, no matter what…]

Otto: [I am talking to Emilia-sama now.]

Garfiel was about to interrupt Otto, who was speaking in a quiet voice. However, Otto cut him off and asked only Emilia for an answer.

Looking back into Otto's eyes, Emilia's amethyst eyes shook slightly.

And then――,

Emilia: [I'm sorry, Otto-kun. You've been working so hard since we came to the empire... no, since before we came to the empire, when we had to go help Subaru and Rem.]

Otto: [...because that's what I'm supposed to do. So, I'll give you my thoughts on how I will do it.]

Emilia: [Yeah, I know. ――We need to do our best. And since we need Otto to give it our all, we'll ask him to hang in there until we meet Subaru and Rem. Even if Otto-kun collapses, I'll forcibly carry him on my back. So]

Otto: [――――]

Emilia: [So let's try reaaally hard to both save Subaru and Rem and keep the people of the empire from dying as much as possible!]

Emilia was aware that she was saying something very unreasonable, and she knew it was a very selfish request. Even so, Emilia had stopped giving in before she even started doing what she wanted to do.

For that reason――,

Emilia: [――Let us blow new wind into this battle.]

A fierce cold wind blows in, filling the verdant grasslands of Vollachia with a blanket of white air.

As they struggled with the falling temperatures and chilly air, many of them stopped in their tracks.

Around them, people stop moving and exhale white breath, some of them with eye-catching features upon their bodies. Male or female, regardless of age, they all have one thing in common: they have weapons growing out of their bodies.

Some of them had swords for their arms, others had entire legs made of steel, some had heads that were shaped into hammers, and others had shields for their backs themselves.

As she had heard, Vollachia was home to a wide variety of demi-humans, it was indeed a battlefield that never ceased to amaze her, as so many people had gathered from so many different parts of the empire.

But even if their bodies are weapons, it does not destroy all the problems in front of them or protect them against everything, as evidenced by their wounded and fallen.

So, taking a big breath in,

Emilia: [Everybody! Get away from here! I'll reaaally try to do my best here!]

Emilia said this to the fallen people ――the Weaponkin and hurried forward with her large strides.

I should try to draw their attention to myself so that no further pursuit can be made against them.

However, Emilia's idea was unnecessary.

It was not that it did not work. Enough had already been done, and the other party's eyes were drawn to Emilia.

Because waiting at the top of the ramparts, where Emilia was headed――,

???: [――You, again, isn’t it?]

Even Emilia's admiration for the first time she saw a Weaponkin was somewhat shallow, as even in the Vollachian Empire, the melting pot of diverse races, there are very few examples of the race.

Her eyes shone gold, and two black horns gleamed dully on her head. She is a girl wrapped in an air of intimidation that belies her petite stature, catching the return of her thrown Flying Winged Blade in her small hands.

Looking up at the other person standing there, Emilia pointed a finger at her in a sharp gesture and said,

Emilia: [Yes! It's me again, Madelyn! A passing Spiritual Arts User, Emily!]

Madelyn: [You're that annoying girl. The other day in the battle, you couldn't beat this dragon――]

Gnashing her teeth hard, Madelyn's expression turns increasingly dreadful.

Viewing Emilia as an enemy, Madelyn raises her Flying Winged Blade at Emilia below, hoping to redeem herself for the recent battle in Guaral――,

Emilia: [――Eeh!]

The next moment, as before, an ice block larger than City Hall crashed into Madelyn, and the battle between Emilia and Madelyn began with a roar.
