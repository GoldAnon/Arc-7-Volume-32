*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Even in the land of the Empire, where a wide variety of demi-human people lived, there were those who were regarded as heretics.

The "Insect Cage Tribe" was exactly that, and even in an empire where demi-humans of various species were intermingled, the reality was that they weren’t free from being seen as strange and heterodox.

 In appearance, the Insect Cage Tribe did not differ significantly from the human race.

Many of them were brown-skinned, and they had a custom of tattooing, but did not have any other obvious characteristics like the “Cyclops Tribe” and “Evil Eye Tribe” with their distinctive eyes, or the “Multi-Arm Tribe” and “Long-Leg Tribe” with their distinctive arms and legs, or the “Beastman Tribe” or “Halfbeast Tribe.

Still, there was a reason why the Insect Cage Tribe were looked at in a peculiar way by other races: their way of living.

That was their way of living in symbiosis with "insects" within their bodies, which was a unique characteristic of the Insect Cage Tribe.

As mentioned above, compared to other demi-humans, the Insect Cage Tribe had little difference in appearance from the human race. 

However, that wasn’t the case. The tribe had "insects" in their bodies and inherited their characteristics.

It was, so to speak, the acquisition of characteristics of demi-humans after birth, and the forbidden art of remaking the body in which one was born ――that was the primary reason they were shunned by other demi-humans.

This distinguished them from the Weaponkin, who were born with a metalized part of their body that they could reforge into a weapon of their choice as they grew up, and from the Glow People, who were believed to take in the soul of the person they killed, thereby increasing the luster of the brilliant stone that grew on their forehead.

The way of life of the Insect Cage Tribe, who did not mingle with others and never left their homelands, was shrouded in mystery.

Since false knowledge was often spread with prejudice, some of the rumors would be hard for the Insect Cage Tribe to avoid laughing at if they had the opportunity to hear them.

However, there were few opportunities for the rumors to be corrected, and there were again no opportunities for the misunderstandings to be cleared.

The most common misconceptions were the timing of when the insects were introduced into the body, and the connection between the insects themselves and the Insect Cage Tribe ――in other words, the history of the Insect Cage Tribe.

To begin with, it was quite dangerous to put "insects" into the body.

In the southern region of the Vollachian Empire, deep within the village where the Insect Cage Tribe lives, there is a cave where "insects" live, and the cave is called the "abyss" because of the deformed creatures and poisonous air that pervades it. The "insects" that inhabit the cave have a strange appearance and are fundamentally different from the insects that are commonly thought of.

No one knows who came up with the idea of integrating these mysterious organisms.

The knowledgeable opinion is that it is probably an extraordinary method found by shamans, shinobi, and other aberrants who seek extraordinary knowledge in order to gain power that cannot be obtained through conventional methods.

In any case, given their existence, the existence of the Insect Cage Tribe is merely a byproduct.

The ancestors of the Insect Cage Tribe were the ones who wished to live in symbiosis with their natural powers by inserting mysterious "insects" into their bodies, and this madness has been passed down to the present day.

Returning back to the original topic. ――The Insect Cage Tribe waits until they are twelve years old to receive their first "insect".

Until that age, they train their bodies and minds to be suitable vessels to receive the "insects," and when the actual ceremony takes place, they are recognized as a host for the "insects," and the time of hatching is appropriately arranged.

After that, it is said that an insect has hatched only when it is recognized that the symbiotic "insect" has been completely mastered and is under their control, thus allowed to call themselves a full-fledged member of the Insect Cage Tribe.

The ritual is forbidden until the age of twelve, because taking in "insects" is a risk to one's life.

Those who challenge the ritual before they are physically and mentally ready will be eaten alive by the "insects" that they try to incorporate into their body. The minimum age to challenge the ritual is twelve, but as long as the vessel is not ready, the age is allowed to be extended to 15. If the vessel is not ready by then, they will be deemed unqualified to be considered a member of the Insect Cage Tribe and will be thrown into the "abyss" to be used as food for the "insects"

The ritual of taking in those essential "insects," and the suffering associated with it is indescribable.

There are different types of blood in the human body, and when one tries to compensate for lack of one type of blood with the blood of another, taking in a different type of blood can endanger one's life. The suffering of the " insect" ceremony is similar to that.

The feeling that all of the blood going through one's body is poison, rotting one's organs and burning one's brain.

The "insect" grows into a chrysalis that tests the host to see if it is worthy of being its vessel, and then spends three days and three nights deciding whether to use it as its vessel or to dissolve it and devour it.

When the chrysalis finally opens, if the human form is still intact, the ritual succeeds and the "insect" becomes a symbiote.

The first physical change occurs in the Insect Cage Tribe when an "insect" is taken into the body and hatches from the chrysalis.

Some acquire antennae and wings, some develop compound eyes, others grow multiple arms and legs, and others are covered with shells on their hands, fingers, and bodies.

The fact that these characteristics are similar to those of real insects is the reason why the Insect Cage Tribe is called the Insect Cage Tribe, despite the fact that the "insects" they take in are not insects at all.

Of course, even if the form changes, the essence itself does not change.

However, it is also true that there are those who view the Insect Cage Tribe, who perform rituals to transform themselves after birth, as abnormal people who wish to become a vessel for "insects",

The prejudice that awaited them at the end of their suffering, and yet the way of the Insect Cage Tribe remains the same.

In order to be recognized as a member of the Insect Cage Tribe, a person must take in a single "insect". However, the more "insects" one takes in, the more powerful one becomes as a warrior.

Therefore, the best warriors of the Insect Cage Tribe have taken in at least three "insects".

However, the greater the number of " insects" taken in, the greater the risk of them cannibalizing each other inside the body and endangering the life of the host. Therefore, the number of symbiotic " insects" is directly related to the quality of the warrior.

The current chief of the Insect Cage Tribe is known as a warrior among warriors, and is revered and respected as the hero of his tribe for having taken eight "insects" into his body.

――And, Kafma Irulux is a monster that has taken in thirty-two " insects".

The birth of a monster that overshadows even the feats of heroes, a monster that went against the code of the Insect Cage Tribe from the very beginning.

The ritual of implanting an "insect" is not supposed to be performed until the twelfth birthday for fear of endangering the vessel’s life, but Kafma took in his first " insect" when he was only a few days old.

The madness of a man who was the elder brother of the chief and who remained inferior to his younger, superior brother, was directed against his own child.

When Kafma became aware of his situation, he was told this about his father.

His father was executed by his younger brother, the chief, and his true intentions were unknown. However, his father declared his son had died soon after his birth, isolating Kafma and performing the ritual of putting an "insect" in him every year.

Ironically, Kafma's existence was discovered, and he was first taken out of hiding at the age of twelve, the same year his brethren were to undergo the ritual of inserting "insects," and Kafma was already a monster living in symbiosis with 13 insects.

Even among the Insect Cage Tribe, opinions were divided on how to deal with Kafma, an existence unimaginable to the tribe.

The father, emotionally executed for breaking the law and cursing his child, was already dead, and the reason Kafma was able to incorporate over a dozen " insects" was completely unknown  ――eventually, his uncle, the chief, declared that he would take responsibility for Kafma's existence and allowed him to live.

This was not untrue, and Kafma Irulux was grateful to the chief.

His uncle, by blood, for better or worse, maintained a certain distance and discretion in his dealings with Kafma, and did not direct excessive blame or apologies toward him for his father's actions.

His uncle's attitude, neither particularly kind nor heartless, was a statement of his awareness that Kafma was not to be treated specially as a member of the Insect Cage Tribe, for which Kafma was grateful.

No matter how my uncle treated me, the fact is that I am an anomaly among the tribe.

Yet this generation, still unaware of the pain of inserting " insects" into them, keeps Kafma at a distance, while those who have been allowed the opportunity of incubating the insects are fearful of the unimaginable number that Kafma has incorporated into himself.

The Insect Cage Tribe is regarded as heretical by other tribes, and Kafma has become even more heretical among them.

Of course, Kafma has no reason to be blamed or persecuted.

Kafma could have ignored the stares he received and continued to live his life as he had in the past, without any ties to the outside world. However, despite being raised differently from others, Kafma's character was noble.

I did not appreciate the environment in which my own people were afraid of me.

To become a member of the Insect Cage Tribe, one is required to insert an "insect" inside yourself.

However, Kafma passed through that stage before he became self-aware. So he spared no effort to understand his brethren in different ways.

He actively interacted with others, learned how to be a warrior from his chieftain uncle, and showed that he was not different from them by being tenacious in his interactions with all generations.

In order to be respected as a warrior of the Insect Cage Tribe, he challenged the ritual of adding a new "insect" into his body.

There was some opposition. Kafma, who had already taken in thirteen "insects," was unique in the history of the Mushiko tribe, and there were high expectations for how much growth he would achieve simply by growing up.

They said it was a mistake that should not have happened, that he would lose his life before it hatched.

Kafma knew what those old men were thinking, but he did not think it was a good idea to stop.

Before receiving permission, Kafma took the "insect" and went through with the ritual unsupervised. Kafma later learned that he had inherited this reckless behavior from his father.

But this time, Kafma recklessly took in his fourteenth " insect," and after three days and three nights of suffering and vomiting blood, he survived.

And so Kafma Irulux finally hatched into becoming a member of the Insect Cage Tribe.

Kafma, despite his peculiar birth, was possessed of a noble spirit and won the outstanding respect of his tribe, making him the strongest in the history of the Insect Cage Tribe.

In the Vollachian Empire, it is the strong who are honored and glorified.

With the hopes and expectations of his entire tribe in his hands, Kafma also set out to make his mark as a "General" of Vollachia and to show the strength of the Insect Cage Tribe as a tribe.

Naturally, there are those who like to gossip everywhere. Sometimes, he received heartless abuse and harassment from those who believed false rumors about the Insect Cage Tribe. But these were trivial matters.

It was trivial for Kafma once he got to the outside world. Yes, it was trivial.

――Kafma Irulux was a "monster" born out of the history of the Insect Cage Tribe.

With a noble spirit and a sense of camaraderie with his fellow countrymen, he took the initiative to fight the enemy and protect his tribe.

However, no matter how hard he tried, his tribesmen continued to draw a line between Kafma and themselves. Because they knew the difficulty of coexisting with insects, they could not see Kafma as similar to them.

Therefore, for Kafma Irulux, leaving his homeland was hope.

Only in a place where there are no fellow tribesmen, no Insect Cage Tribe, can Kafma see the light that he seeks.

Everyone in the Insect Cage Tribe is supposed to undergo the process of hatching as they grow up, to hatch, and to recognize that they are not monsters finally, but only one being――

△▼△▼△▼△

Garfiel: [――Roar!!]

Kafma gnashed his molars hard at the howling, furious, golden tiger that leapt in front of him.

Kafma did everything in his power to meet the enemy, who explosively enlarged his upper body and raised his sharp animal claws ――a warrior who called himself Garfiel Tinzel.

Kafma: [I apologize for underestimating you!]

With a flap of his back-torn wings, Kafma released purple thorns from his outstretched arms.

Although a newcomer among the "insects" that Kafma has adopted, Thorns were used frequently because of their ease of use. However, even with its suppressive power, it couldn’t stop Garfiel's momentum.

The claws that scooped up the head of the thorns and the floor of the rampart, and the sensation of the insect screaming inside shook Kafma's brain.

The seemingly endless amount of thorns were part of an "insect" that Kafma had taken in.

Naturally, if they were hurt, there would be a reasonable backlash. They suppressed it with their energy and acted as if they were not responding.

Garfiel: [Gaaaah!!]

Garfiel stepped in with unstoppable momentum, and out of the corner of his eye, Kafma slid down the ramparts with the acceleration of his wings and slipped past the fierce tiger.

The impact, a thundering roar, echoes just off to the side, and Kafma is horrified that his spacious evasion was switched with one that had barely enough room to spare.

It was even faster and more powerful than the attack and defense that had just taken place.

Either one grows in battle, or one draws on one's stored strength, neither of which is realistic. Almost every change in force that occurs on the battlefield is a reduction in power.

Of course, the perfect pre-fight condition is lost with every second that goes by once the battle begins, and one's energy reserves are depleted, and one's best results cannot be achieved.

That is why it is important to unleash the greatest firepower and skill with the first moves in a battle.

Of course, Kafma is no exception to this rule, unleashing maximum firepower and fighting techniques on the enemy.

And Garfiel ought to be, too. ――it should be that way, so it does not make sense.

Such an increase in power and speed while fighting, regardless of details of beastification.

Kafma: [And you, you must be seriously injured――]

Kafma's attack earlier, it could be described as a sneak attack or a poison assassination of sorts.

Whether the means are good or bad, Kafma does not abstain from the act itself. If elegance is the difference between life and death in battle, then one should choose the means that suit one's desires.

If those obsessions are related to whether or not a person is capable of performing at their best, then it would be a different story.

Kafma: [――――]

Whatever the case, the injuries to Garfiel's entire body were unusual.

The largest injury he sustained was head trauma from Kafma’s attack, but he also suffered a lot from the "insects" that burrowed into his insides. However, the same methods would not work.

Having swallowed the Fire Magic Stones, Garfiel's body is still burning red-hot.

His whole body is covered in flames, but inside his body, it must be in a more unmanageable state of conflagration.

While the host body is at risk when taking in an "insect," an "insect" without a host is also extremely vulnerable and can easily die off if it is thrown into a harsh environment, even for a moment.

There was no such thing as an "insect" that could live in a continuously burning body.

Kafma: [The idea is terrifying.]

Even if one can use healing magic, it cannot kill "insects" that are not intended to wound. However, the "insect" must be removed in order for the magic to heal the wound.

This was the best way to break through that contradiction, but it didn't seem like it was something he did with his mind.

Rather, it is probably the result of following instinct rather than thinking with one's head.

If he had thought with his head, he would have never been able to swallow the magic stone and burn his body.

Kafma: [――Hk]

The moment he slid to a defenseless side, red antennae shot out from Kafma's shoulders like a cannon shot.

Garfiel's body is blasted off the ramparts with a roar as the tips of the "insect's" antennae, deformed by his shoulder bones, pierce his steel-like abdominal muscles and blast his screaming body off the ramparts.

A crushing blow, but Kafma did not go unscathed.

Kafma: [Guh]

Kafma's cheeks tensed up at the bone-numbing pain of having two of his antennae snapped off at the base. If victory comes at the cost of pain, Kafma might as well just go down on his knees.

But, Kafma was not foolish enough to kneel here.

Because――,

Garfiel: [Gaa! Ohaa! Ruuuaahh!]

Garfiel, supposedly blown away, crawled up the ramparts, his claws piercing the walls, and leapt high before Kafma's eyes.

Red steam erupted on the side of his body where the antennae supposedly pierced, and the wound closed up. Kafma exhaled as the healing magic's pale light violently glowed with phosphorescence, and the wound healed rapidly and unexpectedly.

Kafma: [Ha.]

Kafma puts a hand over his mouth, realizing it was an impulse to laugh.

Then as if giving up, he put his hand down and shook his head loosely.

Kafma: [This is Agreeable.]

Conceding it.

Kafma Irulux enjoyed his battle with Garfiel Tinzel to the fullest.

Garfiel: [Oaaaah!]

The howling Garfiel brings his arms down as they fall in a vertical motion, golden circles. Kafma raises both arms and decides he can't stop it, so he pushes forward and goes under Garfiel's groin and behind him, aiming for his exposed back, which he can see from the side.

However, Kafma's winged slash, fired without turning to face him, was knocked away by a rising stone that intervened between the two. Just before Kafma's attack could reach him from below his groin, Garfiel placed his outstretched leg on the floor and activated his Divine Protection, blocking the attack.

Moreover, his wings struck hard as if it were hard stone, and torn noisily ――on the other side, Garfiel's hind legs are released violently, with his front feet on the ground.

Kafma: [――Hk!]

With their backs to each other, Kafma's body goes flying after a powerful blow.

His efforts to stay on his feet were a disaster, and his outstretched body failed to dissipate the impact, bouncing off the floor, spitting blood, and sending Kafma's tall body bouncing over the wall.

Once, twice bouncing high, he saw Garfiel's face as he spun around over his rolling momentum.

To the bottom――,

Kafma: [For the second time――!]

His chest opened, and his ribs spread; his reddish organs stored deep within thrummed, and their shockwave surged forward straight into Garfiel.

This, Kafma's trump card, was not the result of introducing a new "insect" but a new organ created by the coexistence and symbiosis of the 32 "insects" that had been inserted up to that point.

The functions of multiple "insects" are combined to release a shockwave that engulfs and destroys everything in its path with a ferociously precise vibration, a destructive blow that pulverizes the target into pieces.

The moment any warrior is exposed to it, invisible to the eye, it turns them into a bloody mist.

Kafma: [――Buh]

That conviction remains unshaken as Garfiel's golden hair is now stained with blood.

Any warrior will be turned into a bloody mist. Therefore――,

Kafma: [――Monster.]

Braking his tumbling body with his arm against the floor, Kafma looks up.

Then, Garfiel, with his blood-stained upper body trembling, mouth wide open, rushed in. Straight at him, the "monster" struck a blow that would have killed any warrior.

[――――]

The huge fist swing caught Kafma in the face, causing his opponent's jaw to leap as he reflexively counter-punched. The fist strike went wild as it was, and a red flower of blood bloomed across the wall.

It was an epic battle that no one could interrupt, a clash between monsters.

"は"
Kafma: [Ha.]

Exhaling and looking beyond the pain, Kafma pours all of his energy into it.

Born a rare monster from a peculiar place, that was the reason Kafma Irulux had been kept away from his brethren, a fate he himself had cursed.

By leaving his closed-off hometown and stepping forth into the wide world, Kafma had tried to learn.

On what grounds was he so confident that he was not a monster?

However, the reality was different.

Kafma's extraordinary abilities were considered unconventional and heretical even in the outside world. Many that he stood shoulder to shoulder with as soldiers of the nation feared Kafma's prowess and shied away from his abnormality.

"If I was a monster everywhere, in the end, it is a fate I can not escape," Kafma had thought.

However――,

???: [――Come up, General Third-Class Kafma! Together we will do everything in our power to serve His Excellency! What, don't think too much about it; we are all monsters, just like you!]

The words of the large man who laughed loudly and masculinely had been a blessing for Kafma.

Wanting to deny that he was not a monster, Kafma had tried to ingratiate himself with his brethren. Disappointed when that wish was not fulfilled, he had tried to seek it outside, and still failed.

However, how about if he looked upwards?

Monsters had gathered together that even Kafma Irulux, who was feared as a monster, was no match for.

Kafma had not wanted to be told he was not a monster.

He had not wanted a solitude that could not be shared with or understood by anyone.

Even though he was a monster, the world had not left Kafma behind.

Therefore――,

Kafma: [――And I will fight you, again]

While Garfiel's entire body was bathed in a barrage of antennae fired at ultra-close range, he forcibly endured it by healing his wounds as soon as he sustained them.

The mechanisms of the "monster" before his eyes, uncommon defensive power and vitality, and likely super-regeneration that also included the power of a Divine Protection, were what had caused Kafma to grow zealous.

Though the thorned vines released from his right arm had wound around the fierce tiger's entire body, it had forcibly untangled itself while its skin was torn to bits by thorns. Covered in carapaces that brushed off every slash, his fists directly collided with Garfiel's shining silver gauntlets, and the carapaces shattered spectacularly.

The "insect's" egg that had been planted with a flick of his left hand burned in flames, and the shockwave emitted by his pressed knee that churned internal organs was still unable to overcome that recovery ability and fell flat.

Refreshing. Aah, what a refreshing thing.

In the end, he was a warrior, and no matter how he might pretend otherwise, he was a monster, and matching with the "insects” that cheered inside him, before he knew it, a smile had stuck to Kafma's cheeks and would not come off.

Thirty-two "insects" were shouting in joy that something closer to them than their own family, with whom they are one, had the chance to show their full spirit.

Victory had to be wrought.

For the sake of his cause, for the sake of His Imperial Highness the Emperor that guides the empire, for the sake of rewarding his benefactor who raised him to these territories, and for the sake of his tribesmen who wish to improve the status of the Insect Cage Tribe.

Garfiel: [――Where the fuck ya lookin’ at?]

A voice could be heard amidst the pain, the suffocation, and the accelerating thoughts that coated his brain.

Both sides are so intent on pounding each other with such ferocity and rapid-fire power that the other could die, that there is no room anywhere for a straight-up exchange of words, but they can hear each other.

A pair of green eyes in front of him stared toward him, and a bloodshot glint pierced his soul.

Sharp fangs clicked as they tried to sip blood and flesh, and the sound of creaking bones made all perception go away.

The monster in front of him howls, while using everything in such a way to direct the battle.

Garfiel: [My amazin’ self is here.]

Kafma: [――――]

Garfiel: [I ain’t gonna let anythin’ get in the way of this moment.]

A moment later, colors fade away from the world, the sound of the wind and the ringing in his ears cease to be heard, and that great enemy in front of him becomes all that remains in Kafma Irulux's world.

Kafma was ashamed of his own inadequacy, thinking how tactless he had been.

Then, he quickly tossed that embarrassing tactlessness aside as well and nodded his head.

Kafma: [――So, it's just you and me.]

Instantly, fists crossed and slammed into each other's faces, and time accelerated.

An open palm gripped his face, and Kafma's skull screamed from the strength of his extraordinary grip. But Kafma also put his hand in his opponent's mouth, at which point he poured thorns into his opponent's body.

If he cannot break them from the outside, then he will start from the inside.

The overflowing thorns ravaged the inside of his body, and the conclusion of him being devoured from the inside was imminent. But Garfiel, with thorns flowing into him, swung Kafma’s body up and down, slamming him into the city wall.

Kafma: [――Hk.]

As his back was buried into the rampart, he was lifted up and dropped again. Up and down. Up and down. Up, up, up, up, down, down, down, down, and stomped.

A crack formed in the rampart where his entire body was buried, and the tip of the star-shaped pinnacle split in two. His vision was dyed red, and instead of breath, blood gushed out.

Still, the thorns did not lose their power and continued to flow into Garfiel's body.

Until Kafma was exhausted, the "insects" were hungry for victory.

Garfiel: [――Ga!]

The open mouth of the great tiger could not bite through the thick bundle of thorns. No matter how much his claws tore into them, the undulating layers of thorns were too thick. He couldn’t free himself of it no matter what he did.

But the thorns were finite, there was a limit to how much he could spit out.

If Kafma were to run out at this point, he would be giving up his best chance of defeating the other insurgents who were closing in on the ramparts. But the victory would be worth it.

――No, the monster that was Garfiel Tinzel was worth it.

Kafma: [Ah, aah, aaaaaaah!!!]

Ignoring the pain of every bone in his broken body, Kafma's throat screamed out a heroic cry.

The overflowing thorns filled Garfiel's body to the brim, and the pressure of the deadly thorns would cause a rupture that leads to death.

No matter how hard he tried to twist his body, no matter how he transformed into a beast, it wouldn’t let him escape.

Gathering all the "bug" reserves in his body, Kafma held Garfiel down and leaned forward to wrest victory――and then he saw the unbelievable.

Kafma: [――Wha]

A great, golden-haired tiger that swelled up to the verge of bursting from thorns that poured into his mouth. The pressure of the thorns was quickly lost before his body exploded.

Why? ――It was because an escape route had been created for the thorns that entered his body.

Garfiel's sharp claws tore across his own abdomen, and thorns overflowed from the wound.

His terrifyingly desperate tactics were barbaric, bringing him to death’s door. If thorns rushed into a wound that was created, the wound in the stomach could be opened for the same reason that the mouth could not be closed. Then his body would be split in two, and it'd be settled.

Yes, it was too stupid and barbaric of an act to invite such a death.

But the instant Kafma witnessed the barbarism, the momentary emptiness in his mind gave Garfiel, who was on the verge of tearing himself apart, a moment to catch his breath.

He closed his jaws. There was a sound of thorns being torn apart, and the great tiger's large mouth closed.

Losing the decisive blow using thorns, and before Kafma realized it, Garfiel's fist struck, and the hard impact of his silver gauntlets smashed Kafma's face.

Having fallen onto the wall, a fist slammed into Kafma’s face as he lay on the wall. The shock that hit him deeply inflicted decisive damage to the rampart.

With a roaring sound, the ramparts of the imperial city of Lupugana, which were said to be iron-walled, began to collapse.

Kafma looked straight ahead at Garfiel, who pulled back a fist, feeling the sound collapse and his back collapse.

A boy who slowly undid his beastification and regained his original human form――the wound in Garfiel's abdomen, from when he had torn himself open, was closed with a plume of blood.

His fatal wounds, in a spectacle, as if they had never existed at a terrifying rate, were blown away.

What a ridiculous sight!

Kafma: [...Monster]

So, right after, he muttered to himself as if to catch his breath, the collapse was fully realized, and the ramparts collapsed.

Falling amongst the crumbling ramparts and rubble, Kafma's consciousness slowly faded away, fading away, until there was nothing left to hold on to――.

Kafma: “Your Excellency, I apologize…”

As I fell, I felt ashamed of myself for playing the loyal servant at the last minute.

――The voices of "insects," which I had been hearing since I was born, seemed to be unusually quiet.

△▼△▼△▼△

He forcefully grabs the man's body as he falls defenseless, kicking the debris to escape the scene of the collapse.

Grinding the ground with his heel, he killed his momentum and turned around to see the city walls crumble with a deafening roar, opening a large hole in the strong fortification.

Garfiel: [A New wind in opening a hole.]

Remembering Emilia's order, given before the start of the battle, Garfiel's cheeks contorted as he thought about the words. The corners of his mouth, which had been torn wide open, hurt, and Garfiel screamed, "Gou!"

He hurriedly puts his hand on the wound and activates his healing magic.

Garfiel: [Oh, shit, that hurts …but]

Roughly healing his torn mouth, Garfiel stares down at his hands.

The sudden fierce battle and, frankly, the feeling of being hit like he could have died --but the horrific wounds all over his body have closed up, and the seeping pain becomes a lingering sensation.

Even while turning into a beast, he was able to maintain a certain degree of composure while continuing to fight, he thought. Thanks to that, he was able to recover from his wounds quickly. ――But is that really all there is to it?

Garfiel: […Is my amazin’ self gettin’ stronger?]

Clutching his open hand, Garfiel lets his thoughts slip.

There was no real feeling. Fortunately, Garfiel had never faced an opponent to whom he had to give his all.

Except for the battle against the "eight-armed" Kurgan in the Water Gate City, Garfiel has not been fighting using all of his strength in all of his battles.

As a result of having those constraints removed and having once again fought with all his might, there is a definite sense of accomplishment.

Alone, he broke through the barrier when compared to before. And that he made sure of that in this battle.

That's why――,

Garfiel: [――I'm gonna give back yer reputation as a monster.]

That's when Garfiel lowered Kafma's body, held under his right arm, to the ground and snorted.

Kafma, chest rising and falling slightly, breathing, although he knows that this is war and that if he truly wants to win, he shouldn't let his opponent live.

Emilia said she wanted to reduce the number of people who would die by our own hands.

And Otto, likewise, told Garfiel to beat them until they couldn't stand on their feet.

Indeed Emilia said these words from the bottom of her heart, and Otto said them out of concern.

And, he wanted to fulfill that.

So this time――,

Garfiel: [――It’s my amazin’ self’s win.]

And so, having defeated one of the pinnacles of the star, Garfiel pumped his fist in the air.
