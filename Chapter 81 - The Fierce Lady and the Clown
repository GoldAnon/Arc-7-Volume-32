*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

 ――Sacred Vollachian Empire, Under the reign of its current emperor, Vincent Vollachia, was enjoying an era of peace and tranquility unprecedented since its founding.

There had been small skirmishes, but other than the rebellion of Yorna Mishigure, there was no situation where thousands of people were involved in a conflict.

As long as the relationship with the Kingdom of Lugunica, which has been in a standoff for many years, remained stagnant, no civil war or even a situation of falling into territorial disputes with other countries could happen.

 It was easy to say that the times were on their side, but that does not bring to mind all the hard work that has gone into maintaining this peace.

 First of all, was this a feat that can be accomplished simply by having the times on one's side?

 To continue to take the wars away from the Vollachian Empire, which had been a constant source of strife and reason for conflict, for nine years of its reign, was a contradictory act of kindling a bonfire on thin ice.

It is the skill of Vincent Vollachia, the current emperor, who was even called "pacifist".

However――,

???: [――Though I'm sure his Excellency would never be happy to be called a 'pacifist' himself.]

???: [Is thaat so? You don't feel bad about being recognized for your deeds, regardless of whether they were right or wrong, do you? In fact, the stability of the country is what His Excellency the Emperor wants, isn't it?]

???: [So you're proud to be called a "Demi-Human Lover"?]

???: [Undeniably. I'm the one who popularized the name in the first plaaace!]

???: [Good grief, this looks to be the wrong person to make an example of. These days, my old friends who visit me are an odd lot. It keeps me occupied, though.]

The woman smiled a wild smile on her beautiful face and narrowed her green eyes as she brushed her bangs back from her forehead.

She was tall and slender, with a supple, well-trained body.

 Her long, smooth-skinned arms and legs and feminine curves are enclosed in a merchant marine-like garb, and she carries a curved sword in its scabbard beside the fine chair on which she sits on. Her whole body is filled with the high spirits characteristic of a warrior, as if to prove that it is not an ornament but a practical weapon.

 Above all, on her left cheek, there was a long, large, white scar that ran from her forehead to her chin.

 It was an eye-catching scar, and once you saw it, it was burned into your mind and hard to forget.

 However, even the scar was nothing more than an ornament to the person who gave others the impression that she was beautiful, the "Scorching Lady," as she was called.

――The "Scorching Lady" High Countess Serena Dracroy.

 That was the name and title of the matriarch before them, one of the greatest nobles in the Vollachian Empire.

And to Roswaal, her counterpart, she was a friend with whom she had been in contact across the country since before this all happened.

Roswaal: [Of course, as long as you are serious when you call me an old friennnd.]

Serena: [Friends or not, I'm not going to play such trivial games with you. First of all, when you are a high-level count, all anyone wants to do is to talk about profit and loss. Sometimes I want to have a luxurious small talk without such things. Is that too much to hope for?]

Roswaal: [I'm not saying it's too much to hope for, but I'm heartbroooken by that sorrowful plea.]

With a small chuckle, Roswaal reached for a cup from the table in front of him and sipped his tea, enjoying the warm aroma. The aromatic, warmth danced on his tongue. ――Unfortunately, Roswaal cannot glean much more than that from the food and drink.

The lack of taste in anything he eats or drinks is part of the burden Roswaal had to bear and the price he had to pay in order to get to where he is today.

At any rate, there was no way he could not thank her for the hospitality she had extended to him as a guest.

There, Roswaal glanced at the petite figure sitting next to him, the one who had probably enjoyed the taste of the tea on Roswaal's behalf, who let out a small sigh,

???: [These tea leaves have lost their potency. It's recommended that you change the waitstaff.]

Her sharp crimson eyes narrowed, and she commented on the tea with an even sharper statement.

Roswaal closed one eye at her relentless and dismissive tone, while its recipient laughed in amusement with a "Ha,"

Serena: [Something so clearly stated. Should the waitstaff be changed?]

???: [Yes, they are being disrespectful to the tea leaves.]

Serena: [In fact, with everything in the household being so busy, I was the one who brewed this tea.]

???: [Is that so? Then, it would be for the best if you did not make it.]

Serena: [I like her. She is a girl who is not afraid of making up her mind. You have a fine wife.]

With teeth showing in response, Serena looks at Roswaal mischievously.

As usual, she is a woman of great magnanimity, or perhaps, a woman who shows a forgiving attitude toward rudeness and impoliteness. Despite her position as a prominent noblewoman, she does not have the usual personality of being obsessed with authority.

This way of thinking and being had not changed since the first time they met.

" However, I'm not the kind of person who caaan't tell the difference between rudeness and an insult. Please watch what you say, Ram, because this is only marginally humorous.

Ram: [That is understood, dear.]

Roswaal: [――. Serena, I must correct you; she is my servant, nooot my wife.]

Serena: [I see; it wasn't that your demi-human tastes were finally restrained. The relationship between the two countries was tense, but I had thought not having an invitation to the ceremony was cold.]

Roswaal sighed at Ram, who had calmly accepted what he had pointed out and then unconcernedly moved closer. Serena's response as she chuckled to herself also seemed slightly off from Roswaal's intentions.

However, from experience, Roswaal had known for a while now that the deeper he dug into this subject, the more detrimental it would be. Therefore, he would not dig any further.

In any case――

Ram: [Even so, Ram was surprised when she heard it. That is, Roswaal-sama and Count Dracroy had such a close relationship.]

Serena: [I doubt I could unscrupulously call a relationship without contact in years "close.] When I think about it, you come to visit me without contacting me in this hectic situation...If you were to be that overly rude, I would surely end up wanting to burn you to death like my father.]

Roswaal: [Serena, that joke isn't very funny if you're not from the Empire.]

Serena: [Hmm? Is that so? In high society, it's usually a sure bet at making people laugh.]

That statement, which had unintentionally made Ram look daunted, was a joke which poked fun at one event from her succession conflict――In fact, it had come from the true story of how she had burned her father to death and seized control of the Dracroy household.

Since she had said that the sword wound on her cheek was also inflicted by her father before she killed him, it had made Ram reflect on her courage in having ended up deciding it was a funny anecdote, and on the attitude of the Empire that laughed it off.

When Roswaal had gotten to know her, she had still been a teenager ――Serena had visited the Kingdom of Lugunica on business, and had endeavored to resolve a dispute that had occurred there.

To put it simply, since he saved Serena's life when she had been targeted by assassins, and moreover, revealed that the attempt was orchestrated by her father, who had shunned her, his ties to the Dracroy family were unexpectedly deep.

However, Serena's personality had not changed before or after that fierce experience, so she must have been born with her fortitudinous, fiery demeanor.

Roswaal: [It's true that I want to reminisce over your high society conduct but...As you might have guessed, there was a reason why we suddenly visited without contacting youuu..]

A pleasant chat with an old friend was also enticing, but there was nothing important to Roswaal other than the fulfillment of his long-cherished wish.

Everything in Roswaal's life was for the sake of a wish that had sunk into the deepest recesses of his heart. ――Therefore, his visit to the empire, and even his blinking and breathing, were all contributions for the sake of his dearest wish.

Serena: [――――]

Currently, Roswaal and Ram had parted ways with Emilia and the others, visited the territory of High Countess Dracroy in the northwestern part of the Empire, and were having an audience with Serena Dracroy, the lord.

Needless to say, the purpose of the visit was to secure Subaru and Rem, who had disappeared from the Pleiades Watchtower and were believed to have been hurled to the distant land of the Empire. For Roswaal, it would have been enough if he could secure Subaru, but he had not done a foolish thing like saying that aloud.

In any case, they would bring their missing friends back to the Kingdom. That was what this journey was for.

However, even if they were to say that their goal was to merely bring them home, the matter not that easy or straightforward.

For the four major countries other than the Kingdom of Lugunica, they all had their own reasons for why coming and going was difficult. The city-state of Kararagi, which required connections and a lot of money, was relatively preferable, and one could say that the Holy Kingdom of Gusteko was excusable in its ease of understanding, as long as they had not erred in their timing and approach to faith.

From that point of view, the Empire, which did not get along with the Kingdom, surpassed the rest in difficulty.

Relations between Lugunica and Vollachia had historically been bad for a long time, and although they had now miraculously confirmed a non-aggression pact, that too was doubtful in how far they could freely trust in it.

Rather than proof or a sign of friendly relations, the confirmed non-aggression pact gave the strong feeling of a warning that, since it was time for both countries to shift their focus inwards, to be careful not to interfere with each other unnecessarily.

It appeared likely that there was a connection between the matter of the national border now being blocked, and the backing for the non-aggression pact.

Or, possibly――,

Serena: [――This major incident shaking the Imperial Capital was also a plot by a faction that wants to annul the non-aggression pact or something? There's a limit to how suspicious you can be. It's an idea unbecoming of a man of the Kingdom.]

Serena's green eyes suddenly narrowed as she guessed exactly what was on Roswaal's mind.

This courageous and intelligent woman was sociable like this and had catastrophic tea-brewing abilities, but she was one of the very few in the Empire entrusted with the role of High Count, with powers of observation that were the real deal.

Imperialism, unlike the way things are done in the kingdom, does not question age or origin if one has the ability. Inevitably, the more capable one is, the higher position one obtains.

Accordingly, Serena Dracroy has earned and continues to hold the position of a high level count.

The point she just made is another possibility that Roswaal has considered and taken to heart.

By the time Roswaal and his group entered the empire, the fuel of the rebellion was already smoking. Until now, firefighting, which had been done at the first sign of trouble, had not borne fruit.

Naturally, there must be a cause if a full-scale rebellion is to be considered likely.

That is why――

Ram: [――A war for territory with the Kingdom of Lugunica, that is what they are looking for.]

When Serena pointed out that she was skeptical, Ram, placed her hands on her knees, and spoke in a quiet voice.

The eyes of the heroine turn to Ram, and she stares straight back at them with her light crimson eyes.

Ram: [So long as the reign of Emperor Vincent Vollachia is threatened, there were those who do not desire the tranquility that has being created. If so, what do those people want after destroying the peace and quiet? It is natural to wonder if that is the Kingdom of Lugunica.]

Serena: [Is that so? There are people who rebel because they don't like the idea of anyone being superior to others. Such was the case last year when one of their leaders pointed their sword against me.]

Ram: [Let's leave those peculiar instances out of the discussion.]

Serena: [Not so much peculiar, but certainly not the purpose.]

With a finger running along her shapely chin, Serena scrutinizes Ram's opinion.

Roswaal did not interject during the discussion because he saw nothing in Ram's opinion that needed correction. He had never discussed these pending issues with Ram, but he was not surprised that she was also concerned about the same possibilities as he was.

In any case――

Ram: [Serena, surely you do not wish to go to war with the Kingdom of Lugunica either. Unless, that is, you are so outraged that you want to rebel against the emperor.]

Serena: [Fortunately, I've never been dissatisfied with His Excellency's meritocracy. The behavior of General Yorna, whose tantrums from time to time are also a stranger to me as someone who possesses territory far away from the Demon City. It's just.]

Ram: [It's just?]

Serena: [What kind of speculative opinion is that, that they don't want a war with the kingdom? Because if you say that our side is not good enough, then the wind is going to blow in my heart as well.]

Serena's lips relaxed while she looked at her, her gaze mingling with a tingling sensation.

It was her way of expressing her own pride in Roswaal's words. She is called the "Scorching Lord," and as a woman who holds the position of high-ranking noble with her prowess, it is unforgivable for her to be underestimated.

That is not the basis on which to compare Ram's remarks about tea.

Serena does not put her heart and soul into tea, but she does put her heart and soul into her family name.

Serena: [How so, Roswaal; was I mistaken? Or was it you who was mistaken?]

Roswaal: [Hm…]

Serena pursues to block off his escape route, and as he looks back into the green eyes of his old friend, Roswaal noticed Ram next to him, peering at his side.

She probably sensed the change in the air that it was going to be bad depending on how he answered her.

In addition, if Serena's good mood were to be soured, it would make it very difficult for Roswaal and his group to move around in the empire. Not simply because they would lose their backing and support, but also because Serena knew of Roswaal's true identity.

Taking all that into account, and adding Serena's personality and humanity into the mix, the best answer that Roswaal could give in this situation is――,

Roswaal: [Well, sorry for the misunderstanding. Let me rectify that. ――If it comes to war with the Kingdom, there will be a lot of needless bloodshed. That of the empire, too. That's why I don't recommend it.]

Serena: [Ho?]

Serena's eyebrows raised at Roswaal's matter-of-fact response.

The pale sword scar on her face trembles, and the pupils of her eyes narrow slightly. Although it was not connected to an outburst of emotion yet, it would depend on the words that followed.

But he has already decided on the words that will follow. Neither does he intend to try any lies or tricks on her.

Were the Kingdom and the Empire to fight, a great deal of Imperial blood would be spilled.

The heart of the matter is――,

Roswaal: [After all, the kingdom is home to the "Sword Saint," Reinhard van Astrea. Every imperial soldier who comes across the border will become a great river of blood.]

Serena: [Oi, oi, that's not allowed!]

Roswaal: [Although it's not allowed, as long as the possibility exists, there is no alternative buuut to put it on the table for discussion. As you say, it's a backdoor way to sabotage the discussion, though. However.]

Then Roswaal cut off his speech and closed one of his different colored eyes, leaving the blue one open, and closing the other.

Roswaal: [The trick behind this is not to hesitate at all to be the first one to be cut.]

Normally, trump cards and tricks are to be saved as much as possible, but this is not the case with the "Sword Saint.] The most effective move is the first one, and the reward is great.

Above all, the person in question is willing to accept the role.

Serena: [Good grief, a military strategist who will not even let me do a thought experiment properly.]

Suddenly, the atmosphere from just before dissipated; Serena plopped down and leaned her weight against the back of her chair. She pursed her lips as if she were a sulking little girl.

Serena: [In the empire, I have only heard rumors, but… in your eyes, is the "Sword Saint," a supernatural monster?]

Roswaal: [The previous generation's "Sword Saint," haaad a certain cuteness, but the current generation's "Sword Saint," is more appropriate for that expression. But if you do not know them, you will not get a sense of them.]

Serena: [You speak as if you have seen every "Sword Saint," that has ever lived. But…]

Smiling at Roswaal's response, Serena raised a shapely eyebrow.

Due to their long relationship, Serena believes that there is no way Roswaal is going to leave things up to chance here, and is considering the matter carefully.

However, not all Imperials, with her being the exception, are good listeners by any means.

Roswaal: [If you overestimate the power of your country or underestimate the power of the "Sword Saint," you will not be spared tragedy. So, I dare to blow a contrary wind in your mind. You should nooot fight.]

Serena: [――――]

Roswaal: [Annnd also, if you are going to wage war against the kingdom, then I'll be your opponent. Shall I show you? The mercilessness of relentless magical attacks from a high altitude beyond your reach.]

Although shrugging his shoulders and trying to be coy, Roswaal is also quite the strategic force to be reckoned with.

Although not as powerful as the "Sword Saint," he can still kill thousands of common soldiers by simply flying through the air and wielding magic. If he chooses the right kind of battles, he can even push through a battle line by himself.

Serena: [I can easily believe that, unlike the "Sword Saint," story. I have seen a glimpse of it with my own eyes.]

Roswaal: [That was more than a decade ago. I can show you much more developed magic now than I did theeen.]

Serena: [you're a hard man to figure out., aren't you? However, outstanding power comes with its own set of constraints. That's probably why you can't act freely within the empire.]

Roswaal: [Correct!]

It was Roswaal's turn to show his hand, saying that this was now a done deal.

In fact, if the tactics that were just discussed were implemented, Roswaal could continue to rain magic from high in the sky, out of reach of people, reducing the empire to cinders until his mana ran out.

However, there is no one else in the world today who is capable of doing such a thing with magic, with the exception of Roswaal. It would be the same regardless of how much he tried.

Showing his magical prowess in the Vollachian Empire was as good as revealing his true identity.

Therefore, Roswaal must refrain from any flamboyant behavior after entering the empire.

The same reasoning and restrictions have been imposed on Emilia during their time apart.

Serena: [In that case, there's a chance that you'll lose your temper right away and forget about that.]

Roswaal: [I'm going to have to rely on the children I have with me theeere. Well, given the circumstances, Garfiel should be able to control her, so I'm not overly concerned.]

Or rather, if he couldn't have that trust, he wouldn't have gone through with the separate activities in the first place.

This is the current situation because he trusted that it would be acceptable to entrust himself to their judgment. ――He was sure Otto and Petra would look at him with disgust if they heard him say "trust.].

Serena: [――Let me guess, you were not the only ones who entered the empire because of this situation, were you?]

While Roswaal and Ram exchanged words, it was Serena, who raised herself from the backrest, before continuing. As she meets their gazes, she traces the sword wound on her cheek with her finger.

Serena: [What you're looking for… No, you are looking for someone. It looks like they're very important to you guys.]

Roswaal: [Even though you and I are close, it's a difficult thing to nod your head annnd ask.]

Serena: [But your actions attest to that. Otherwise, one would not go to the trouble of crossing the closed border to come to Vollachia. ――Unless it is destiny.]

Narrowing her eyes just slightly, Serena speaks in a quiet voice.

Roswaal raised his eyebrows in discomfort, as he had no idea what she was talking about. But rather than question the truth of those words, Ram was quicker to nod and say, "Yes"

Ram: [There is someone Ram really wants to bring back. Someone whose life is as precious as Ram’s own.]

Roswaal: [Ram.]

Ram: [No amount of deception is going to work with her.]

Roswaal, however, is unable to come up with a counterargument.

If they say that action itself is the answer, they were, in fact, right.

Ram: [However, if you're going to show weakness, then you should show it in a different way.]

Serena: [Don't be so hard on Ram. It's a healthy thing. What surprises me more is that you went to such lengths for something so important to her. You seem to care about her a lot.]

Ram: [Yes, because there is no replacement for Ram.]

Roswaal: [That is an undeniable fact, but I'm somewhaaat concerned about the way you put it.]

The one they wanted to bring back and were advocating for as such differed between Roswaal and Ram. However, Serena, who was unaware of that, seemed to have had a misunderstanding.

Since they wanted to secure assistance, they would share detailed information about the people they were searching for afterward.

Serena: [――Whatever the case, I understand why you warned us not to start a war.]

With the conversation having returned to Roswaal’s warning, the discussion before this last one, Serena's expression had suddenly stiffened. She looked at the naturally tense faces of Roswaal and Ram, and with a mindful gaze, she continued, "But,"

Serena: [I'll listen to your advice, but I can't vouch for the attitudes of the other citizens of the Empire that are not like mine. Most of them would go into a frenzy even if they were to be told they had no chance of winning if they were to fight the Sword Saint.]

Roswaal: [That is a point of difference with the Kingdom, where there is no need to explain the true power of the Sword Saaaint.]

Ram: [Yes, that is correct. In the Kingdom, if you had the chance to get a glimpse of the "Sword Saint" Reinhard, there would be no need for an explanation after that.]

Since the four great countries had a shared treaty prohibiting Reinhard from leaving the country of Lugunica, the people of other countries had almost no chance of seeing him.

If they could have gotten that chance, there also would not have been any need to bother with this kind of roundabout persuasion.

――One look at the Sword Saint Reinhard van Astrea, and anyone could have sensed right away just how foolish a thing it would be to oppose him.

Only lunatics living in a world completely detached from reason would not understand that.

Serena: [If I'm spoken to so seriously, I guess I can only hope that His Excellency will suppress the rebellion without incident, or that the rebel side taking his place has some reason.]

The rebellion had already broken out, and the topic of what lay beyond its objectives had begun.

If the rebel side had concrete ideas and no unreasonable ambitions like fighting the Kingdom, the war between the two countries and the massive bloodshed Roswaal had spoken of could be avoided.

Of course, there would be nothing better than if the Emperor's side could suppress the rebellion properly.

Roswaal: [No matter how this civil war is resolved, it would be troubling if an attack is aimed at Lugunica afterward. Because a quarrel with the Empire would be an incident I have not planned for.]

――All of Roswaal's actions were a path leading to a long-cherished wish that must be granted.

Thus, that he had acquired the opportunity to have an audience with Serena in the Empire was also no exception.

Desiring help for the sake of bringing Subaru back, and persuading her, an influential person in the Empire, of the futility of going to war with the Kingdom were both like that.

For Roswaal's dearest wish, Subaru's presence was indispensable.

Furthermore, a war with the Vollachian Empire or something of that sort was not included in the path Roswaal had to follow. So this was not the time for a war between the Kingdom and the Empire.

There must be no interference until the day of the Dragonkindling Ceremony, when the covenant between the Kingdom and the Dragon will be renewed.

Issues that interfere with the Royal Selection must be removed.

For that purpose as well――,

Roswaal: [――We must have His Excellency the Emperor quickly suppress the rebellion, and far extend this first period of peace and tranquility since the founding of the Vollachian Empire]

Serena: [Hmm? I haven't seen that evil face in a long time. Is this some kind of sinister plan?]

Hearing Roswaal's words, Serena raised her eyebrows in amusement.

He was not himself aware of the evil face that had been pointed out, but from what she said, there probably was something like that. Nevertheless, Roswaal's plans should not run counter to Serena's expectations either.

She was also a member of the Imperial nobility, and as long as she did not take part in the rebellion herself, she should naturally side with the Emperor.

Ram: [Count Dracroy]

Suddenly, next to Roswaal as he was thinking that, Ram started her own conversation with Serena.

At that call, Serena looked at Ram and,

Ram: [A moment, please?]

Serena: [Sure, I don't mind. Though please don't call me Count Dracroy. I just want to chat with a friend...Serena, please]

Ram: [Then, Serena-sama. ――It seems you are really close with Roswaal-sama, right?]

Serena: [Yes?]

Serena's eyes widened when Ram, who had changed what she called her, stared fixedly at her. However, her face instantly turned mischievous, and she nodded and said, "I see, I see."

Roswaal had a bad feeling about what it was she had just realized.

Serena: [You're curious about how I met this guy, right? From the looks of it, you guys also seem to have known each other for a long time, but...]

Ram: [It's been just ten years..]

Serena: [In that case, we've been acquainted just a little longer. Ram, can you drink?]

Ram: [It is not at the same level as with tea, but Ram is pretty picky.]

Serena: [Alright!]

Serena slapped her knees, grinned at Ram, and said, "I feel the same way."

It seemed like they were going to laugh at old memories and dive into the flow of drinking. Moreover, if they were going to talk about when he had met Serena, Roswaal also had a few youthful indiscretions.

Roswaal: [Serena, I appreciate the invitation, but we have some urgent business to attend to. About those matters――]

Serena: [You want my help with that, don't you? If that's the case, then even more so, you probably shouldn't spoil my mood. If you haven't seen me in a while, then at least have a drink with me]

Roswaal: [...Ram.]

Giving up on trying to persuade Serena, whose attitude showed no willingness to listen, Roswaal looked at Ram.

Just as Roswaal wanted to bring Subaru back, Ram had come to the Empire to bring back her other half, Rem. She thought since she had sincerely answered Serena's earlier questioning, she might be able to bring her back to an honest discussion, even if she was still conscious of the effect of those cups of sake.

However――,

Ram: [Barusu aside, Ram does not think it would be wise to refuse Serena-sama's offer for Rem's sake.]

Roswaal: [Really, is that the only reaaason?]

Ram: [Of course, if Ram could also hear stories about Roswaal-sama before he met Ram and the others, then even if we end up in the same stalemate, I could say it was an excellent plan.]

Ram was not ashamed if it could serve her goals and have real benefits at the same time.

And much to Roswaal's regret, Ram and Serena were exceedingly compatible. There was no doubt that their drunk talk would also be lively and get along well.

My oh my, would that be the beginning of a headache for Roswaal.

Roswaal: [In a sense, should this also be accepted as a necessary price to pay?]

All so that they could reach their goal, then leave the Empire and return to the Kingdom.

When he called on an old friend and asked for help, he was prepared to pay some kind of price. However, he had by no means thought it would turn out like this.

Serena: [Just now, another guest left right before you guys arrived. That was a lively companion, so I was about to feel lonely.]

Ram: [Because they were also close to you?]

Serena: [Technically, it was the husband of the guest with whom I had been close, but yes. They should be back soon, so I'll introduce them then. Right now, rather than that――]

Having stood up, Serena headed to the display cabinet in the corner of the room. When the door opened, lined up inside were a variety of bottles of alcohol, large and small, and they could see she had great taste.

Serena chose one of them, and while she was returning with three glasses from the same shelf,

Serena: [It was when I was serving as an emissary representing my father, that I happened to meet Roswaal. I was targeted by assassins in the kingdom I was headed to... they were controlled by my father, but Roswaal saved me there.]

Ram: [So that is how it was. And then.]

Then, alcohol was poured into the glasses on the table, and the old stories began.

With Ram, who had taken a keen interest, the talkative Serena's topics were lively, and while Roswaal felt ashamed, he decided that this was a necessary moment and surrendered himself.

Roswaal: [――――]

All for the fulfillment of his dearest wish, and to regain the pieces necessary for that――.

――Roswaal's predictions had missed their mark, and he was unable to not get even more deeply involved in the Empire's civil war, when two days later, the name of the black-haired maiden siding with the rebel army, "Natsumi Schwartz," reached Count Dracroy's manor and Ram restrained High Countess Serena Dracroy.
