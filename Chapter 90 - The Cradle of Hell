*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

???: [――No doubt! In front, At first bastion the "Two" Arakiya!]

???: [It's presumed to be the “Nine” Madelyn Eschart at the second bastion! A herd of flying dragons is circling overhead!]

???: [The Guardian of the Third bation, is Unidentified!]

???: [Also, no confirmation on the guardian of the fourth bastion! Unable to confirm!]

???: [Fifth bastion, such a flashy attack… Not a General First-Class! It is General Second-Class! Kafma Irulux!]

The situation of the battle, coming in one after another in a loud voice, almost like an angry shout or a scream.

The soldiers assigned to the role of long-range observers took up as high a position as possible, their eyes bloodshot as they tried to get as much information as possible by looking at the majesty of the Imperial City of Lupgana in front of them.

The decisive battle for the Imperial Capital had finally begun. If one considers the simple difference in the number of soldiers as a force ratio, the war potential of the rebel forces was nearly double that of the regular army of the Imperial Capital If all of these troops were to run out onto the plain at once and clash head-on, it would be obvious who would clearly win the battle――.

???: [Lupgana, the fortified Imperial Capital, and I never wanted to be on the attacking side to capture it.]

Shaking his distinctive hairdo from side to side, Zikr Osman wrinkles his brow as he writes the reported situation of the battle on a map he has spread out in a simple command center.

As a General Second-Class of the empire, he played his role as "commander" and still has a high level of loyalty to Vollachia, so it can be said that the Imperial Capital was the armor that guarded the heart that he had to protect.

He would never have considered himself in a position where he had to capture the Imperial Capital and vanquish the existence of the one who, perversely, calls himself the emperor on the throne.

???: [The situation, however, will not wait for your incessant whining to cease. ――No, not only you. Time passes equally for everyone.]

Zikr: [Abel-dono…]

Abel: [Get back to the battle situation. Get the reports from the long-range observers. Priority should be given to the third and fourth bastions…, even if trivial from there, we will identify the guardians."

Zikr: [Yes! Strengthen the long-range observations on the third and fourth! Without a doubt, a general is on the battlefield!]

Zikr nodded and ordered his nearest subordinate, causing the air to fluctuate at a dizzying pace.

Savoring the dry air on his skin, Abel squinted from behind his Oni mask at the imperial city in the distance, outside the cloth-covered command center, where the star-shaped ramparts that protected the city.

As noted previously, the rebels outnumber the regular army in terms of force ratios.

However, the assembled rebels lacked the sense of cooperation, choosing instead to run off in haste to avoid handing over glory and military achievement to someone else.

In addition, the enemy whom they needed to attack was confined to the innermost part of the Imperial City, which painted a picture of robustness and solidity.

As was discussed when capturing the fortified city of Guaral, some believe that if the attacker attempts to defeat the defender, a simple force would require three times the number of men.

Considering that the defensive measures of the Imperial City are far superior to those of Guaral, the difference is all the more pronounced.

Above all――,

Abel: [――The existences that disturbs the ratio of forces is those who are equal to a thousand men strong.]

Zikr: [It is a decisive battle in the defense of the Imperial Capital. Although the battle has started earlier than expected, how many of the Nine Divine Generals have been recalled?"

Even though the rebels are a bunch of rabble, if they are knocked on the head and doused with water, they will turn while they listen. Then one can incorporate them into one's tactics and shape them.

That is, if the water they bathe in doesn't wake them up and make them close their eyes forever ――which is no easy task when confronted with the "Nine Divine Generals".

Abel: [At the very least, Arakiya, Madelyn Eschart, and Moguro Hagane will be in play. Kafma Irulux is equivalent to a General First-Class on merit alone, and Olbart Dunkelkenn may refuse to participate due to his injured arm, but that is unlikely.]

Zikr: [There will be no participation by General First-Class Goz or General First-Class Groovy. Is that what you think?]

Abel: [Goz Ralfon may or may not be alive, and Groovy Gumlet may or may not have been recalled from the West, it depends, but the latter is hard to mobilize. The uncertainty concerning the West's movements is neither orchestrated by this side nor theirs. ――But it reeks.]

In the first move of the rebellion, Goz, having successfully defended Abel in his fleeing the Imperial Capital, is likely to have died, as no further information about his whereabouts is known.

Goz, who enjoys the extraordinary support of his soldiers because of his command ability and personality, would be one of the greatest threats in the war if he were to turn against the other side. However, knowing the identity of the impostor sitting on the throne, it is unlikely that Goz will take the other side, making him nothing more than a sacrificial pawn to be dealt with.

Abel: [The only possible effective use of a sacrificial pawn is to use its death …Goz Ralfon's death and to put the blame for it on the rebels to boost the morale of the soldiers.]

Zikr: [...I do not wish to think about it. If I had remained unaware of the situation over there, I would have also taken up the sword for the sake of General Goz, even if it meant dying.]

Even Zikr, a "General" in his own right, mourns the supposed death of Goz.

It is a feat of trust and achievement that Goz Ralfon has built up, and in fact, if they were to resort to such a scheme, it would be necessary to reestimate the strength of the regular army.

But, if they had intended to do so, the best time would have been before the war began.

Abel: [Whether he deliberately missed the opportunity, or whether he didn't want the uncertainty of any increase in force due to improved morale, either way, he's going to pull strings.]

Running through his thoughts, Abel puts his hand on the edge of his mask and tries to grasp the other party's intentions.

When it comes to reading one's opponent, there is no room for compromise. However, this time, the opponent is out of the " usual" category, and in addition, he is the enemy who knows the color of his heart better than any other opponent so far.

The conditions are the same here; however, different win conditions mean different options. And so to the place where Abel is staring at the map is――,

???: [――Abel-chin, Abel-chin!]

A lively voice sounds through the entrance of the tent, and with a quick movement, a little girl jumps into the room. She takes her place at the desk and turns to Abel, her blue eyes shimmering with immense emotion.

???: [I want to go, too! Big bro is there, remember? I can't wait!]

Abel: [Nonsense. Do not add to the uncertainties. How can you be sure that your brother is in the capital?]

???: [There was a girl named Madelyn! She's the one who took Big bro and Rem-chan! If she's there, then maybe the two of them are there too! Right?]

Abel: [That is certainly not a guarantee. Furthermore, your brother and that girl are of little strategic value in the current situation. Do not misplace your priorities.]

???: [There is nothing more important to me than Bro bro and my friends!]

With a banging on the desk, the girl ――Medium snapped at Abel's words.

This is an emotional and unspoken opinion. Ultimately, as he said, there is no reason other than emotion to give priority to Flop and Rem, who were both kidnapped under the circumstances of this war, and therefore, a worthless decision for Abel.

There is an alternative, though, which is to let Medium loose.

Abel: [――. Causing needless dissension, is it?]

Medium: [――? What?]

Lowering her eyebrows, Medium tilts her head, unconcerned about her own worth. Or are they being emboldened because they rightfully appraise themselves? Abel quickly dismisses it as overthinking.

In any case, he cannot afford to devote much time to her.

Abel: [No matter how much you talk about what you want, you know it's too lofty of a goal right now. If you cut loose the reins and head for the battlefield, your life will be needlessly spent.]

Medium: [Mm! No way…]

Zikr: [Miss Medium, Abel-dono is concerned about your safety. And I agree with him; I cannot just let you go.]

Looking up and down, Abel and Medium glared at each other respectively, and Zikr, who interrupted them, rebuked them in a calm tone.

Zikr, the General in command, is also aware of the unpredictable situation of the battle. Nevertheless, it must be difficult for him to deal with the unreasonable Medium.

Without any such emotion on his face, the man called "Womanizer" met with Medium and spoke,

Zikr: [That solid city wall is made up of five bastions. One cannot attack the Imperial Capital without considering these five bastions. At the very least, we need to understand our opponent's intelligence and eliminate any ambiguity before we talk about this again――]

Medium: [That is why! I'm trying to figure this out too! I really want to hear from Madelyn about my Big bro, but it's hard to do that, so from an unguarded spot, I'm going to go inside…]

Abel: [――Wait.]

After Zikr's attempt at gentle persuasion, Medium emotionally tried to push him away. However, Abel felt caught in the middle of Medium's statement and stopped them.

Abel grabbed Medium by her slender shoulders and turned her to face him, causing her to widen her eyes.

Abel: [You said, an "unguarded spot" If that is one of the bastions, where did you get that from?]

Medium: [Where, you say? ...Oh! That's right! Sorry, Abel-chin!]

Her complexion changed at the question, and Medium grasped Abel's hand on her shoulder with both hands. As she continues to hold his hand tightly, her blue eyes again waver emotionally, and she,

Medium: [I should have told you this! Well, the third bastion is full of dolls, and the fourth bastion is nothing but black shadows …neither of them has a girl like Yorna-chan!]

Abel: [――――]

Medium: [Abel-chin?]

Abel's eyes widened slightly at the message from Medium's mouth. However, this is immediately quashed with a blink of each eye, disappearing in a silent exhalation.

The words that are spoken, there was no need to scrutinize their content. Of course, he knows their meaning. The question is how the information was obtained――,

Abel: [Who made you tell me this?]

Medium: [Huh?]

Abel: [Who?]

Opposite his gripped hand, with his left hand, he grips the back of Medium's head and turns her to face him.

Medium gasped as he looked straight into her blue eyes. Then she moved her pale pink lips to answer Abel's question.

So, the answer to that question was――,

△▼△▼△▼△

――Otto Suwen closed his eyes in thought, engulfed in a vast, raging, whirlwind of information.

Otto: [――――]

A storm of voices, voices, voices pouring in.

From right to left, from top to bottom, from front to back, an unending assault of voices.

It was the second coming of the cradle of hell, where he once spent his earliest years, a triumphant return to his nostalgic hometown.

Otto's "Divine Protection of the Soul of Language" is said to be one of the "outliers" among the many Divine Protections that exist in this world. 

This Divine Protection, which allows one to understand and communicate in every creature's language, has too many flaws to be considered a sword that one is born with.

First, a newborn child has no ego, no self-consciousness, and a vague sense of self.

For a child who cannot firmly establish oneself, the only way to define oneself is through one's surroundings, and for the owner of "Divine Protection of Soul of Language," these surroundings are too vast.

It is not about up, down, left, right, or depth, but literally everything.

More specifically, a child with "Divine Protection of Soul of Language" cannot even distinguish between human, animal, insect, wind, rain, or the ringing in one's ears.

Such a distracted living creature, both in judgment and attention span, could hardly survive.

The only reason Otto was able to go through that period without dying was because of his circumstances.

Otto's wealthy and loving parents, an older and younger brother who never dismissed their brother who could not communicate with them as an obstacle, these devoted family members kept Otto alive.

But even after establishing oneself as a living being, the suffering of the "Divine Protection of the Soul of Language" does not end. Rather, from there, it began.

Those who possess the "Divine Protection of the Soul of Language" risk being isolated from everything around them at the cost of being able to communicate with everything around them. The lack of a sense of belonging is a major cause.

Assuming that talking, touching, and cultivating bonds are the basis of life, the owner of "Divine Protection of Soul of Language" could establish relationships with any creature.

There is no need to limit one's contact with human beings.

Being able to communicate with any animal, insect, and even fish. Because of this Divine Protection is able to connect with all living things, thus making it easy to isolate oneself.

You can be alone forever in the prison of doubt as to who you are.

Due to that, all of the previous holders of the "Divine Protection of the Soul of Language" have died prematurely.

Otto does not even want to think about how many of his fellow possessors of the Divine Protection have died without even being able to speak their names, let alone realize the power of their Divine Protection and let others know about it.

What is the value of living in the midst of unrelenting downpours, in the midst of uninterrupted storms, in the midst of helplessness, knowing that one will never be understood?

In fact, he had never heard of a possessor of the "Divine Protection of the Soul of Language" ever having made it so far.

And Otto understood that feeling all too well.

Literally, the cradle of hell is a place where one is forced to listen endlessly to lullabies that lure one to death.

Otto: [――――]

In a nostalgic hell, Otto consciously narrows the focus of the voices that he listens to.

It is the same way that you pick up only the voices that talk about topics that are relevant and interesting to you among many voices in a crowded place or at a party.

This is an area where many people with "Divine Protection of the Soul of Language" have not been able to achieve, namely, increasing or decreasing the effects of the Divine Protection.

Otto, too, usually sets his Divine Protection to the lowest setting so that his head is not filled with so many words.

He increased the volume of the weakened Divine Protection and raised its intensity to the maximum.

Otto: [――――]

Before, when Subaru pestered him about the Divine Protection of the Soul of Language, he called it a "channel." He thought that that didn't sound so bad, so he opened a channel.

The countless "voices" that pop into Otto's ears and mind are all related to the battlefield centered around the Imperial Capital. Many of them are accompanied by avoidance, loathing, fear, and anger, and many of them are useless, but he scrutinizes them all.

Anyhow――,

Otto: [I have asked a lot of Garfiel, too…]

When Emilia made the decision to enter the battle for the Imperial Capital, Otto concluded that it was Garfiel who would have the most difficult role in this battle.

Because of their prowess as combatants, Emilia and Garfiel are the ones who will be taking on the battle against dangerous enemies. However, they could not let Emilia fight to the death.

Of course, Emilia's life is the top priority even before recovering Subaru and Rem.

Therefore, if Emilia is in danger, he will make her back down, no matter what she says.

Everyone in the camp, except Emilia, has been notified of this fact. However, it is not an option to come all the way to the Empire and return empty-handed; they must bring Subaru and Rem back home with them.

In order to achieve this goal, Garfiel was responsible for inflicting the most wounds and spilling the most blood.

Otto: [Garfiel may or may not know.]

Did Garfiel know how reckless and cruel the instructions were for the role he was entrusted with?

Otto is certainly aware that he has been terribly self-serving and unreasonable in his instructions, and Garfiel probably thought he was being reckless, but did he understand the true nature of the situation?

Or perhaps Garfiel took it as a sign of trust?

Otto: [I do not like this…]

Muttering a few words, Otto thinks of Garfiel's innocent look of trust.

Even if he was giving unreasonable instructions, Garfiel believed that Otto had an idea and that it was his role to accomplish it, and Otto accepted that Garfiel would see it that way and gave him instructions, entrusting him with a role that only he could fulfill.

At first glance, this is an exchange of mutual trust. However, Otto, the party involved, believes that this is not a fair balance of what each party must bear.

Garfiel took risks wherever they went. But not Otto.

All I do is sit back in my comfort zone, feeling pain and guilt. And when all is said and done, Garfiel would say, "As I’d expect of Otto-bro!” I'm not sure how I feel about that.

It’s not a joke.

Otto: [If I can bear it, I should bear it myself. Don't run away from your responsibilities, Otto Suwen.]

Otto placed his hand over his mouth as he reminded himself.

When their camp finally decided on the course of the Empire's upheaval, Otto warned Emilia, "You're going down a thorny path."

In response to Otto's words, Emilia stoutly held her chest and chose her path.

It was probably a stupid idea, a foolish path. If Otto were alone, he would never choose this approach, which was all danger and little gain.

But there was something important in the little that was gained, and Otto was relieved that Emilia chose a path that he would never have chosen on his own.

He was inwardly delighted. Thus, he could not be an outsider.

Out of several possibilities, it was Otto who chose this place.

If blood needed to be spilled for that purpose, he didn’t want to leave the bloodshed to others.

Therefore――,

???: [Otto-san, you can be a real dummy sometimes!]

Suddenly, amidst the flood of meaningless "voices," he heard a clear "voice" and blinked his eyes.

In an instant, the hellish rain and storm receded, and in front of Otto, who was turning around with his channel turned down, Petra's eyes met his with exasperated, frowning eyebrows.

She came up to Otto and offered him a white handkerchief saying, "Take this.”

Petra: [Your nosebleed is really gushing. I’m a little scared.]

Otto: [Nose… Ah, I didn’t notice it.]

Petra: [Seems like it. …Please sit. You don’t have to stand, right?]

Otto looked at the handkerchief offered to him in a daze. Irritably pulling Otto's hand, Petra made him sit on the grassy field.

She then put a handkerchief on Otto's face and wiped off the blood.

Petra: [Is that what happens when you use your Divine Protection a lot?]

Otto: [...Yes. If I increase the number, I’m listening to and the range, it will be like this. I don't really want to do it, but it's an emergency.]

Petra: [So that you don’t lose to Garf-san?]

Otto: [――――]

Petra: [As I thought. Otto-san, you’re really an idiot.]

As Petra stared at him, Otto scratched his head, saying, "I give up.”

Petra's point was correct in a broad sense, although it was subtly different from what she was trying to say. If she was smart, she might have known what Otto really meant and rephrased it.

Petra, the fastest-growing member of the camp, was getting sharper and more strong-willed by the day.

Petra: [I don't think Otto-san would be the same as Garf-san, even if he has a lot of nosebleeds.]

Otto: [Certainly, the amount of blood we shed can’t be compared with each other. Unlike Garfiel, I would die from blood loss relatively easily. But I should be prepared to bleed myself.]

Petra: [Is it because Otto-san told everyone to go?]

Otto: [I’m no match for Petra-chan.]

Otto laughed as he squeezed his nose to flush out the blood that had accumulated.

Only considering the events that had taken place, it was Emilia who had decided that she would participate in this battle, and it was Emilia who declared that they would do it, so Petra's point was way off the mark.

But the reality was that Petra was right; it was Otto who had made her say that.

――No, those were precisely the words Otto wanted her to say.

Otto: [In fact, I am not hurting myself for nothing either. I hate to say this, but my Divine Protection is very useful in war. I can't afford not to use it.]

Petra: [――――]

Otto: [It is difficult to find someone that can help us because of the situation, but it is worth it just to get the information. I just asked Medium-san to take a message. If Abel-san can make effective use of it, the battle situation will be improved… Petra-chan?]

Petra: [Haa～]

Otto attempted to at least make amends by explaining the usefulness of his actions, but Petra's response was one of cold and growing dismay.

Saying, “good grief,” Petra ran her hand through her light brown hair and looked Otto in his round eyes.

Petra: [I don't think I'm as dumb as you think I am, Otto-san!]

Otto: [No, Uhm, yes. I think Petra is a very quick-witted girl.]

Petra: [In that case, Otto-san, I don't think you're as smart as you think you are.]

Otto: [That… it’s hard to reply to isn’t it.]

It's not like I'm proud that I'm an intelligent person and possess an ingenuity that no one else can match.

Otto's self-assessment for why he had been able to come this far would be the number of rules of thumb and small tricks he had, as well as having excellent crisis management skills.

If he started comparing intelligence, he would fall far short of the schemers who predict everything.

However, it seemed that this notion of Otto's had missed the mark here.

???: [Right now, that's not the kind of intelligence I'm talking about. Otto-san, I won't be as much of a useless child as you're thinking.]

Otto: [――. That is]

Petra: [I think I'll be truly useful. For instance...]

Saying that, Petra tightly squeezed Otto's bewildered hand. Then her small hand glowed white, and that glow permeated into Otto.

At that moment, the ringing in Otto's head eased slightly.

Otto: [Is this...Yang magic?]

Petra: [It's part of the magic that I have been learning from the Master. Though, it is still rudimentary.]

Otto: [――――]

Petra: [Otto-san, I also know this time calls for doing unreasonable things. But, it doesn't mean that suffering more is admirable.]

Otto, who was determined to harm himself earlier, held his breath at Petra's words.

Petra sighed a little at the sight of Otto,

Petra: [Even though that’s the kind of thing that Otto-san would always say. I won't tell everyone, Otto-san, but you've been flustered all along, haven’t you?]

Otto: [Uhm]

Petra: [You’re always angry. I know how you feel, but your voice and attitude are too harsh.]

Hearing that, Otto bowed his head and couldn’t even make a sound.

As Petra said, Otto felt like he was stuck in a ditch of misjudgment and misunderstanding, which was uncharacteristic of himself.

Through Petra's small hands, he felt that he could grasp what she was trying to say.

Otto: [It's not great to get a nosebleed, doing what you do is great.]

Petra: [Yes. What would you like to do, Otto-san?]

While holding the still-sighing Otto's hand, Petra lifted it,

Petra: [If I'm present, you can do your best more efficiently. And yet, you want me to stand back because it's not something kids should see?]

Otto: [That’s a bad way to put it!]

Petra: [Would you like me to back off?]

With a smirk on her face, Petra puts pressure on Otto. He succumbed to that pressure. Giving in willingly to it, Otto let out a long breath.

Otto: [――――]

Even now, countless "voices" popped in when he opened a channel. In the midst of the furious momentum that threatened to push him away, however, Petra's hands held Otto's as he was about to be swept away.

A little more, farther, too many, to make it seem like it would be okay to listen.

Otto: [I’ll have Frederica scold me later.]

Petra: [Yes! I'm glad to hear Otto-san say that he would rather have a nosebleed with me than have a nosebleed alone. I don't like nosebleeds, though!]

Otto smiled radiantly and closed his eyes at the sight of Petra, who had decided to help him.

There was no way that this clever girl could not have noticed the slight tremor in his tightly clenched hands.

It was Petra's first time seeing war, a battlefield where her loved ones were involved, and the safety of her friends who were sent away was in jeopardy, and she wished she could do something about it.

Understand those thoughts. ――Use the available hand when I can. Be a merchant.

Otto: [Petra-chan, please lend me your hand. ――I will control the channels on this battlefield.]

Petra: [We will control them!]

Otto chuckled at Petra's brisk reply, "Well, then," he replied, and opened the channels to dive back into the cradle of hell.

――Returning to his nostalgic hometown, Otto could never be as lonely as he once was.
